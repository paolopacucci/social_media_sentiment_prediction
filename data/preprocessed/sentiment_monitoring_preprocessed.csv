REALLY?? oh.. sorry yall  lol
i`m totally gonna have money to actually buy a pair of shoes this time
"Widget is mostly useless - it constantly displays no items while having a list selected that is well populated. Alternately, the widget becomes logged out somehow. Hope this gets fixed."
Off to work at the church
"Okay I guess. Very happy with dev response to my previous review, TY."
"i definitely will , although with the caveat  that i normally only read non fiction..but have more in recent years read novels"
Like the look but it messes up straight away. Instead of saving an entry the app cashed and deleted it instead. Don't get!!
"Lots of tasks to complete today. First, wecloming new members to Canadamigos Social Networking site, www.canadamigos.com, and coffee"

Today is lame because I am not in Orlando  I am soooo looking forward to NEXT friday
"Colleague that 'helped' by creating his unit`s site in iWeb was NOT helpful. Trash code, 24 CSS files for a 4 page site, no optimizing."
No! Why?
Looks clean and this app have those details which other apps doesnt have. This can complete functions which I needed. Great App.

We keep very different hours.
i had added a routine & by default it took a date almost 8 days ahead from today's date... i m unable to change the date... it's frustrating...
Didnt like that to really use it as a planner I had to upgrade
beautiful day... and im working  leaving now so i can get some sun though
Or maybe its just us ....
have to subscribe to link to Google calendars
"I cannot givey opinion, because I cant install the app."

"been using todoist for some months now great app but need to make the google home experience better. it would be great if it would ask to set a time and date and would i like to change the title of the context when it asked if you would like to change the context, add a label and move to a different project."

"Not very expressive frame for activity descriptions, must be in the first stages of development. Guilds look incredible diverse, very surprising it is a social app. Seems the leveling function is standard gaming and well embedded. Hope open sourcing it make it better fit. Passing habits to to-do would be desirable."
Hi  Im Better... Drinking Hot Tea With honey ^^ ... Thanks... Take Care Plis
"HEY, BABEE. ) LOVE YOOOOUUU. >< RP time."
Best planner ever bought the pro edition...it's easy to use and has many convenient functions like tracking overdue tasks.

_Girl OOC sorry we keep missing each other...
My entire plan was suddenly removed
No blood drives in my area.  I`ll keep looking.
"its a great app in general, just want a couple of tweaks that would make using it more streamlined. The biggest thing is I have goals that increase incrementally every day, I would love to have a way to have a yes or no that shows that incremental adjustment. Also, when inputting numerically set goals, I want to be able to just start typing the number and have it replace the default 0.0 without placing the cursor and backspacing to enter a result. Still, the interface is otherwise great!"
im blonding ... slowly but surely im blonding ... i wana scratch my hair but im not allowed
goodnight twitterville! really enjoyed pearl harbor. now off to sleep and cuddle with my hot man!  i will have good dreams tonight! XOXO

"ahahaha, that happens to me all the time.  poor Angela!"
Miles from you   I`m in Essex so give me plenty of warning so I can arrive in time to get at least one of those free beers.
"I'm not sure, but I keep getting these little hidden files in download folder but I believe they're from the calendar. I haven't checked since the update. But I do use this app every day especially for the widgets and the customization. You can get lost in it, but I'd rather have the option than not."

"it`s a perfect day to throw back your head and kiss it all good bye - love it, so cheerful!!  ? http://blip.fm/~5jckp"

"GoodMorning. My Father`s going balistic, and I`d say more but I`d rather not get beat, so Have a Good Day, and please text me"
I really like the app. it's pretty cool! How do I get the 24 HR clock on my Android wear? 5 stars if the 24hr face can is possible on the watch! 🙂
Enjoying the app.
my computers broken and I broke my laptop so I had to use the phone  ahh still on he cause they **** up my order.
"glad i didnt do Bay to Breakers today, it's 1000 freaking degrees in San Francisco wtf"
I love the idea of it but I am having a hard time trying to get started. As I am setting up my dailies anything that I set for weekly seemed like they are all linked together so if I change my days on one task it changes on something else. I like what it trying to do but if this isn't corrected then I will have to find another app.
"Please fix the date format, we're not all backward Americans..."
yes I do! Because he is going to the marines to protect & serve and leaving me!
Would be great if all the features were free
So wish the Carlton game was on live  stupid channel 7 lol.
"well, the requirements are quite high as well"
"Cash grab, and nothing more. Purchased the app a year ago but now due to an issue on the account being asked to pay for it again. Very disappointed and no response from seller. Last update was 1 year ago so as far as I am concerned the developer abondoned it."
Ohhh mannnn they just laid off 3 girls!!!    This economy has to improve soon!!!

"Does not sync. If i enter an item in the agenda. It does not sync with the widget. Sometimes it takes a whole day before it is visable in the widget. In the widget only 2 items are visable. The rest keep saying ""loading"" for days now. Even if i manually sync."
happy mothers day to all moms out there!!
Great app! Just having it on your home screen helps you stay focused because you want to use it every time you see it.
"i got mcdonalds, surpisingly its not a popular drunk food option.  its sucks that all diners aren`t 24hrs here anymore"
"Happy!!! I just found out this amazing app. I love devs from Israel, not discriminating others tho. But I have a thing about calendar view. It shows different month other than the current month, same with the today's date, it shows other dates hmmm...maybe I clicked or touch something? Help!"

"Pretty good, could be better"
"Widget isn't opening calendar. I've deleted and restarted and when I use the 3x1 (I think) it opens to the day only, and won't go back to the month view like it used to."
Would like questions answered I email my questions for answers & I give my contact info for almost two months now but no one contacts me. This is very disappointing especially when I bought this app. Very poor for business kevin

Needed a replacement for Wunderlist. Looked at several disappointing options before finding TickTick. It has everything I liked about Wunderlist plus it has nice extras like formatting in task notes and it lacks some of Wunderlist's annoying behaviors. It also did the best job importing from Wunderlist. The best alternative to Wunderlist. Period.
Decided not to go...I want to see my sweetie  But I can`t.
my tummy kinda hurts!
"it's a useful app, have maybe some things to improve like, the habit set up is not very clear or intuitive"
"Subscription based model for better features. Happy to pay $20 once off if I really like an app, but not ongoing costs that can change any time."
"The recent updates were very amazing. Keep it coming devs. This is close to perfection. However, I hope we can gain items attached to a particular task. Once the task is completed, the items will be given directly to your inventory. This can help us to create weekly task events or bosses. It will be very rewarding. Thank you! Update: One last thing, in terms of habit generation, can we have counting streak instead of count down... The higher the streak, the higher the rewards 🙃"
"I am in Kuala Lumpur. And I know I vanished, haha! I broke up with my last boyfriend, that`s why I`m back!"

"I recently downloaded this app and paid for the premium subscription. I like the app, but I have two issues that are hindering its functionality. The first is that the notifications slate quite buggy. I have 3 different daily tasks which I've set to notify me when they start, and I only receive my notifications sometimes. The second is that my workweek is Sunday-Thursday, and I found out after speaking with their support that there is no option to set a non-standard workweek."

it`s definitely worth it; art not withstanding  I hate moving; and hate packing even more..
"Had written a bad review because I spent a week trying to make the app show two widgets with different calendars. Couldn't do it (and wasted hours!) until I noticed a nearly invisible dot (at least on my screen, I'm using the iblue app) near the widgets. Pressed it and discovered the widget menu! They should really make it stick out or write clear instructions about it on the app. I imagine they try to make it subtle in order to not affect how the app looks, but it took a week to find it."

"Hey, awesome app. It wasn't long until I purchased the unlocked version. However, some things could be improved. For example, you can't change units after the habit is created. And it would be nice to hide the "".0"" part after digits, since mostly it refers to ""minutes"" or ""iterations"" or ""cups"" and it looks kinda sloppy to see your goal described as ""Learn at least 30.0 minutes"" or ""Drink at least 2.0 cups"". If the number is whole, why not just hide that point zero - it'll look neater, I think."

"The simple customization of which calendars are showing with bars at the bottom of the screen is handy, and the widget with a customized compact agenda has been part of my home screens for years.

Have re-defined my routines and activities. Working well.
_Tarrant nice! It`s mommas day
"Really impressed with the functionality, by far the best to do app out there. Functionality is great and the UI is even better - clean, intuitive and perfect to utilize. 10/10 for the lists, sublists and subtasks, even the editable homescreen widget is quality. Looking forward to the paired web app."
So far so good... bit expensive having to purchase a yearly basis to access basic functions as color tags and what comes with it. Translation to Greek is not fluent for the price tag / annually I would apprechiate developers look closer at them. Will give it a try before committing on purchasing it per year. On a positive note love the widget (using however nova launcher). Current rating will change based on the experience.

Great App But I still need a feature that the app should have a custom notification sound selection option so that I can know that notification has come from this app.

Did love this app... But since the update. I seem to lose tasks. Now I do not trust the lists I have created.
"I used to really love this app, but lately it won't notify me when the timer is up. It's hard to keep track of how much you're working"
Everything thing is customizable but there is no timer i want timer for every sub task that i create every single task i do i want a time and daily stats for the same need to download some other providing the same for now when you include this mail me i will download again!!!

nope  we only have one really good cuban place... i`ll have to ask them...
good app but........ i would like to have a feature of having a log maintained of my completed tasks. So that i can go back and check when i completed them for any future references.
"This app was great, but now in 14.1.0 I can no longer click on a project and see all of its sub-projects and their tasks at once. This is a stupidly frustrating change and it completely messes up how I use the app. Why not make this a setting I can change back, OR leave it alone altogether? I will be manually rolling this app back. Thanks for making more work for me guys. SERIOUSLY STUPID ""UPDATE""."

"thanks, feeling good and off to New Forest later"
tut tut. Isn`t charging just fun. Thr new palm pre charging platform looks nifty tho.
This application is very useful in helping keep me organized and paced. The only suggestion I'd make is on the interface. When checking off my tasks for the day the add new task button is in the way of pressing the cross off button. It's a bit annoying but I love this app.
hope yer ok hunny

"Habitica is the best! It's so rewarding completing day-to-day tasks with this app. Your avatar can earn gold, equipment, pets, experience by completing the tasks you choose. Joining a questing party is fun because you're with others, holding each other accountable and encouraging one another. Participating in challenges is great because you work on specific aspects of your life, like positive thinking, exercising, reading, ect. Habitica has helped improve my life, and I feel so much happier!"

"Loved the app but at some point it stopped letting me look at my tasks 
without instantly crashing so I'm not using it anymore. I'll be sure to try 
it again and recommend it to friends if the issue isn't present next time.

"cool, not a big user of DM though"
"YOUR CONDESCENDING ATTITUDE IS NOT HELPING YOR CASE. There is a sublist reorder but NOTHING for the MAIN LIST. THERE IS NO SORT OF ANY KIND says sort by DO DATE or lets you PICK WHAT TO SORT BY, A LOGIC CHOICE. Completed tasks NEED TO CHANGE IMIEDIATELY so you KNOW IT'S COMPLETED & next month IS SET. I DIDN'T SAY IT WASN'T SIMPLE. The INTERFACE is NOT VERY INTUITIVE. I DID LOOK AT HELP & THERE is LITTLE FOR THE MAIN LIST. YOU ARE very IRRITATING so I am going to try other choices."

"Spending $10 once or $5/year for a subscription would make sense to me; but paying $15/year to use a to-do list (when discounted) is really excessive. This is a great tool - actually, I love it; but I find it ridiculous to pay so much just to TEMPORARILY unlock basic features like a calendar. Edit: Since writing the above review, I've found cheaper/free alternatives. The one I'm using is called Treat Yourself. It's free and doesn't look great, but it serves my needs just right and I love it."

I used to really love this app as it provides a Todo list widget that can show a lot of Todo list items compacted into a very small space. However it has started showing full screen ads when adding new items so I'm going to be looking for a replacement.
Thanks! I know.
"Update: I did all the steps.. still not working... It is getting frustrating 😓 I really love this app. But off late it just keeps crashing. Can anybody help? Updated: Thanks for the reply!

"Haha, you didn`t do anything wrong."

"It's a good app for task reminder but it still needs some thing more. One needs to go into the menu to switch to the lists no matter which list has an upcoming task. It should have option to show the mix of tasks from all lists in tiles/widgets on app home interface. I really like the snooze option, quite straight away."

Great App. Keeps me on task and organized. Freezes a bit and didn't show all of my planned events. I had to reprogram but other than that no issues at all.

"Todoist has LOTS of bugs after update. Most annoying: 1 no longer able to select multiple tasks at a time, 2 when writing a task, keyboard blocks view of task box so you cant see what you're typing, 3completeled subtasks used to remain but crosses out, not it disappears (forcing users to relearn how to use the app), and 4 some tasks scheduled to appear under today does not. Makes you question the integrity of the app. I see no benefits to recent changes. Only bugs."

My laptop grew speakers. Now I can watch Charlie with the sound on
Can`t wait 4 a real bed!  haha
"I love this app very much but I've been having trouble recently with it. After a single use, it keeps shutting off by itself. Apparently, it shows me an error that I've not downloaded the latest version of it even though I have and even after deleting and reinstalling it back, it keeps glitching. I don't know what to do D:"
"I tried 3 or 4 times to download this app, import my Wunderlist data, and share lists with my husband. Each time it failed miserably. Not trying again - finding a better app."
awsome application.. i purched it.. but i just want notifation should be blinking on phone like alram clock .. plz add this type of features.. the thing diplys in notifaction should be flash on main screen From last 10 month it's not getting synchronising..

Well done for those peple who made this one for me.
"It`s weird waking up in my own bed. Slightly comforting, but i miss the group. But i`m loving using my own pillow again!"

anytime!.. literally hahaha
I could do with another one now myself. was back to work on Monday after being off for 7 weeks  not good.
"Worked great at first but continously does not sync completely with Alexa. I only use this app as a shopping list with Alexa, but when it only shows 4 of 10 items on my list it's pretty useless. The purpose of the list is so that I don't have to remember the 10 items I told Alexa to add to the list (which show up on todoist)"
It is awesome. Definitely recommend 💜
"just woke up, no school today, we are free"

"for years I use ticktick, I love it so much, I rated it 5 in Play store.. But the recent several changes to the app are make the app getting worse and keep getting worse than before. I incredibly sad and disappointed. for years I rely on ticktick as my todolist app, and now I have to find other alternative that can be as good as ticktick that I know before. that's not an easy thing to do"
This is a brilliant little app! I frequently struggle with executive dysfunction and this app really helps me get things done!
Happy Mother`s day VALK!!

Standing ovation for Wieters. Nobody was sitting down. Insane. Hit into double play though
: no i`m not going.
"Viewing the sub-project tasks inside the main project was an integral feature of the app that I used daily. Removing this without warning as if it were an 'improvement' is unacceptable and makes the app borderline useless for me, and as such I will begin looking for another app that can better suit my needs. Removing features and making pointless changes is no way to retain users."
mmmmm my hair smells guuud.  the wonders of 'pantien' ;D
lmao - That would have taken me at least a week!
"Moved here from Wunderlist, after trying other apps. This is so clean and easy to use and does everything I needed and more. My fiance and I can now both keep track of the grocery list! (So glad it has the ability to share with others)"
Welcome
I feel 5 pounds lighter
It was good now alatm sound of tasks is full but sound is low only this app i have seperate alarm volume and its full
"AAAAARRRRGGGHHH! there is a huge spider in the towel pile, *cries* glad Kerbear isn`t here  sorry mum cant bring the rest in"
Good app but a big improvement would be to have categories for a grocery shopping list. I add things as I run out but that is not how they are found in the store. I would like to group item by product type so I don't miss getting something or have to backtrack.
"Works great! No ads, no unnecessary complexity"
"You know I am so ashamed. I did not watch a single episode of the new GH season.  I kept falling asleep, so I gave up."

"I've used all of the popular and some of the lesser known To Do List apps. This is by far my favorite. You don't have to have an account and has more options. But you should for back up purposes. The only problem I have is that when I miss a task, it says due 10 minutes ago when it's been 2 hours. My tasks do show up on time though. The times vary, but this issue started when I created an account."
I hate TweetDeck when it reaches access limits
On way to Birmingham.. Sewing in the van. Punk.

Can I have a feature where I can maintain a record of how many times I actually finished the activity I was putting in? Include that and it's 5 stars from me.
Good app user friendly
Thats beautiful
"I've only started using this this morning; so far I'm hoping it helps with motivating me to accomplish things. It's definitely a great idea! I kind of am wishing the was done sort of story line to follow along with, like ones you have so many days of completing so many habits you get a clue to find whatever your quest goal is, or something like that would make it more exciting... I'll update my review once I'm a week or 2 in."
Under sooooo much stress lately
"This app used to be great. Now it is garbage. A few months ago it started doubling a few tasks - no problem, I just delete the extras. Now I get 5 to 10 copies of every task I delete. It is worthless.   I can't forget the wait times to open the app, up to 8 minutes of staring at a black screen.   Oh, and the fact that in the past week or two it started giving me ads even though I have been using the paid version for years already.   I let them know a couple weeks ago and got no response."
sweet! make sure to put some in your bag for me
i`m looking forward to the joy of the f1.... hoping its another disaterous race for ferrari and button gets another well deserved win
be patient  you`ll get it soon
"Amazing. Not only is this app cute-to-boot, but it's so easy to use! It doesn't largely focus on the character aspect, which I like because I'm mostly here to organize my life. Everything is covered: To-Do lists, Dailies, Scheduling; its so extremely customizable and in such a simple platform (that I dont have to pay extra for) Not only that, there is the community aspect! Its about holding yourself accountable, and this app is perfect, thank you."
Www//httpe.@com.emile
is still pretty depressed about losing her hello kitty necklace
"One or two minor hiccups when inserting advance appointments which resulted in a difficulty with getting the diary back to 'todays' date. I had to turn the phone on and off in order to correct this. Also had problems with the app widget failing to download after the phone has been turned on. Other than those issues the diary has been great. I would love to have more options to customise the appearance of the app, eg background or page colour options only work when you insert an appointment."
Yeah I guess he does sound a bit odd `cause he`s saying really quickly

a headache once again ugh
"When I first downloaded the app it worked seamlessly, but once I upgraded to the Pro version it began to lag and slow down. I can't access my timeline, store or achievements anymore and it's slow run time is making the app so tedious to use. It's becoming an awful app for me"

"It's very optimised for everyday notifications, notes, list making and planning in general. The widget is quite handy, offering a preview of all the day of the week and tasks and events you have written down! My recommendation."
Hoooray!  I`m hooked already
I`m sorry to hear that! that makes me sad
Easy to use smart and flexible options

_one Could use GarageBand though it`s probably overkill.
Just chillin at home
Literally everything that i ever need in a todolist app... the minimalistic design and AMAZING user interface is soo user-friendly and helpful to stay organised and plan my days accordingly. Honestly this has been nothing short of a life changer for me.
i dont have my iphone until maybe next week!
"Eh, it wasn't for me. Maybe it's because I was using the free version, I didn't think this app was very intuitive at all. First of all, it's very annoying to not be able to set my own reminder times for tasks. I had the option to either choose 9 in the morning or 6 in the evening. What the heck? Secondly, the reminder feature goes off a little too often. Only one reminder is needed. I know I could have turned notifications off, but I did want reminders for my tasks. I should have been able to control the number of reminders. Also, it was pretty lame that I couldn't make multiple lists. I was just dissatisfied overall with my limited options. I deleted and am using another to do list app"
glad its nice there. Gray skies and rainy in wisconsin.
"_zaboo its ok, it just hurts abit i thought i was doing a good job... if i was rude to people i could understand...  x"
"It's easy, smooth and fast."
Wish I could go. Gotta work.
"My prior app isnt any more and they automatically imported all content into this one. The most annoying part is that each item now adds to the bottom of the list, instead of the beginning, I need to fiddle with sorting on each list to fix this and the sorting takes space on the screen! Waste of time each time!"

"I really love this app! It makes me more motivated in doing my tasks. But, the only problem is, after a week while using this app the pop up message ""Connection Error"" began showing up on my screen. I'm connected in our wifi and it's fast enough. If it's just because the app is ""under maintenance"", I would appreciate if you will put a message regarding on that like ""Under Maintenance: Go back for an hour"". It's working now! ^v^"
fingers crossed for you.

"cant contain myself, tooooooo excited"
morning ashleighhh  x
"great app, better than Google's free one. but paying a subscription for such a simple app has rendered this useless. im happy to oay a one off fee, but im not willing to pay a subscription just access other features. hence why its not 5 stars. its just a to-do list.....thats all."
"Love it, but it isn't an Add in on Outlook. It's forcing me to use Wunderlist because I like the feature of it syncing with my Outlook calendar."
"Beautiful design but, I'd prefer a one time charge option for the PRO version"
"Soo tired, couldn`t get enough sleep"
one of my favorite quotes ever
which means you`re just going to have to come back to vancouver and have it our way! hahah
I really like it. But there's one or two thing's that need to be addit. I Personally use it to make a list of book that planning to buy and read this year i know there's other apps for this but love the check list style but i don't like how it get deleted after 30 day at most it will be great if there is Option for never delete Plus adding a imagine option will be nice like wallpaper behind the task name

"_Ross if you look at the js code in facebook you will notice a few js functions...nahh just kidding, a buddy told me"
apparently it`s starwars day today  I like this . Shame I have revision though.
"I really wanted to love this app. It does exactly what I need. Unfortunately it's riddled with bugs. Mostly with repeat tasks. Main one being. If your phone is powered off at a reminder time, it will break the reminder. Resetting the task brings more issues. Also takes 15min for the app to sync with the widget! Contacted ""priority support"" (one reply a day). Seems to have no real interest in fixing the problems. Blamed it on Nova Launcher. Same thing happens with Samsung launcher."
I`m terrified about the surgery next week
"it just opens a-calender, so I'm not sure why I need something between me and my regular calendar app."

"This calendar application is fantastic and it is very easy to use. The best thing about it is that you can set multiple events and reminders. It's great that it has up to 5 reminders that you can set, for an event that you've made. There's also a custom setting for setting reminders to any specific time of your choosing. I'm also glad that it doesn't have autocorrect. There are convenient weekly monthly and yearly views to choose from. Great calendar application! I highly recommended it!"
got my cable set up! WIN!  got my lock put on my door! WIN! feeling a tad neglected... FAIL.
i am going to be staring at hello kitty`s face at 3-9
its too hot in my room. i wanna go swimming.
"Useful program. Could be the center of my daily activities. Would be better-smoother, more integration with Gmail and Google Calendar with, again, better, easy, even default--'scheduled follow-ups' on same screen--Category, Priority, Time/Date. No less important, drag and drop tasks onto other Categorical Tasks to create a Categorical Hierarchy based on Time/Date/Priority-Level in the Task. Then, instantly shows in Google Calendar with a simple, mouse-over 'Zoom-to-Task' in the Calendar."
guessing... Ran 4 miles & gym? Superman you  oxox
"Nice skillz Nick  x love always, Marjorie & Jemimah. Sydney, Australia."
sorry to hear that
"I needed a calendar that would extend my schedule to infinity and with multiple rotation scenarios for a variety of store visits. It does that great. Is it possible to simplify moving events (which actually are my store visits) to other days within the same week or month? It wud be great if you could just drag the store you missed to another day and it would only change that single event, not the rest in the rotation. Thanks."
I should have posted this for the world Pinhole day   I Love this picture. http://twitpic.com/4jb4d
"I have had this app for years now. It is the best calendar app I have used. I like how well it integrates with contacts, and how I am now able to attach files. Definitely makes my life easier."
Love this app! Didn't think I could find something as good as Wunderlist but this app is better! Just a couple of things would make it perfect. Option to change font size and option to add new items to top of list.
"Just cross `cause I`m stuck twiddling my thumbs now, ugh"

"The latest update is terrible. I always organized everything by date of the reminder, which is usually set on the day that it's due, but now I can't even see the due date of each task. I have to click on each task for the the date to appear. In addition, I usually organize each task by tags, the date, recurring if needed, and other details. There's no easy way to adjust all these details anymore. You have to click on each separate icon to fix these to what you want. I use the app begrudgingly."
is still waiting.
It's very good. Moved off Wunderlist since Microsoft is forcing a MS account and will eventually get rid of it. It's not as good as Wunderlist which I miss but it's very good so using this moving forward.
hey Bow when yu comin baxx 2 thaa 614 we miss yu hun  ...614 all day!!
"Not quite Wunderlist but I'm pretty happy overall with how it works. One suggestion would be having a ""Tomorrow"" option similar to my day so you can add stuff to your ""My Day"" the night before."

"I started getting notifications but all came at the same time instead of their specified times, so just removed them and no longer use. Biggest feature I would like see fixed is there seem to be issues with using the ""Today"" option for the task list Widget. Sometimes will only show one task and sometimes when I can complete all my tasks, the next day the list doesn't refresh, still says ""All tasks are done!"""

"I've had this app for a few years, and it worked well until the last several months - it's gotten increasingly buggy and will do things like ""forget"" you checked off tasks as completed and re-list them as incomplete between closing and re-opening the app.  It also had been freezing more and more frequently, to the point where that happens at least once a day, and now I can't even load certain screens.  Because of this, I will not be renewing my subscription this year and will be using another app."

I love it so far. Bummer to have to pay for premium but it's not a bad price. I am only doing the minimum 5 habits because I don't need that many. :) it could use a reminder notification 🔔 Update: still love this app. It's helped me keep track daily.

"This app was everything I needed, I loved it. But after thenlast update I cannot log in to my account so I cannot see my daily schedule. Will not trust it again and I have already unistalled it. I need an organizing app which I can trust. Fortunately all the events were synced to my google calendar but notes and tasks didnt.. So I dont know if I am forgeting something that is pending now."

"Great app, the best time setting interface of anything. Only feature I don't like is if you change the start time of an event it proportionally changes the end time so you have to change the end back to where it was and if you change it enough to span the midnight hour now you have to change the days too."

"Recent major update has strongly impeded on usability of app. I understand and appreciate the focus on subtasks and some other features, however I think the developers have severely misjudged the actual most common user stories. Was always a big fan, paid subscriber for many years, but this update was a major letdown. Unnecessary changes for something that was working almost perfectly."

I bought this great app. Just started using it. I am a procrastinator so I am struggling to meet my goals. I am therefore absolutely relying on this app to help me track my performance. I really like the notifications with the positive words it attributes to me. I like the fact that you can quantify exactly the number or time allocated to the habits and track against that. When I manage to conquer a habit I will write a new review. Cheers
hi holly  i`ll volunteer to try it out first for u! hope ur having a fab weekend xoxox...
Just installed. Keyed in all tasks n to-do list. Server error. Lost everything. Redo. Server error. Lost. Kept repeating. Frustrating = Uninstalled.

Great app but crazy there's no Google Calendar integration!! Even tried setting this up with Zapier but it only creates an entry (with no link to any.do task title) for when the task is created and not when the task is scheduled. Will Google Calendar integration be coming to the app?

It didn`t rain.  Lightly misted though.
i totally owe you a week of on-call duties.  i appreciate not having those while jill is in town
Jquery is my new best friend.
It's a great concept to get work done or take a break from the phone. It would be nice if there was an option to time yourself and grow a tree while doing work on the phone itself like working on Google Docs for instance... If the app allows you to identify some work apps and use only those while the tree grows.
"FML dad didnt leave me any moneyz, so i have 2 wait till he gets home   call me when you finish work?"

now my heart isnt cold  but im still missing you.
Same issue as Don Smith who wrote a review on 10/10/19. Will consider this app but the lack of slide visuals and character visuals makes the app in-op. Current phone is the Google pixel 4xl......perhaps I misspoke in regards to the reply. My issue is not with the visuals but the lack of visuals. Everything is blank for me so literally can not see half of the content.
"Like many others, the new big update has severely hindered my ability to use the app effectively. What used to be simple is now cumbersome with a 3x increase in the number of clicks to accomplish simple tasks. It wasn't broken, why did you have to 'fix' it. I'm hoping they roll back some of these changes, if they don't I will probably need to look elsewhere for a todo app."

"The idea behind the app is nice, but it isn't userfriendly. Finding and adding friends to use it together was so counter productive that it got us to waste time we could be actually doing our daily tasks."
One word to describe this app is AMAZING. Ultimate app for to-do and habit tracking. After many years a single app has impressed me so much. Highly recommended 👍
- that is awesome.

"so bored, i have a headache."
"Used to think it was a 5 star app but they keep making it worse (and worse). Specifically it wrongly interprets touch screen movements putting tasks in random locations rather than where you drop them, often the very end of all your tasks, so you have to waste time dragging it back, sometimes for dozens of items. Reminders bug me the moment I wake up & won't switch off. You only let me move a reminder 15m, 1hr, 3 hrs. So with a list of 20 things I get 20 reminders 3 hrs later. Annoying as hell."
Stood outsiden got the WORST butterflies everrrrr!
"I would be happy to give the app a five star rating as I have reaped many benefits I directly relate to my usage of Habitica, but I am prevented from doing so by recent events. I can only give you a three star rating because suddenly your application no longer functions, with no warning or information as to why or how to fix it. 500 characters is not enough to relay proper data on this issue to the Dev Team, likely by design, and for that I blame Google Play, not the Dev Team of Habitica."
"Looks a lot like todoist. I said ""look"" because todoist is bug free when compared to this one. What a waste of time I had trying to set it up both by natural language and clicking..."

I literally searched for the name of this app and I finally found it.

The best app for to-do lists. It does have a couple of minor issues: * The widget can become unusable once in a while (stuck forever on the loading screen). * It can also take a couple of seconds for an item to be removed after you check it off on the widget.

Fairly awful. Followed all directions on how to cancel the yearly subscription within 2 days of starting my free 7 day trial. Charged on the 7th day anyway. Repeated requests to resolve the issue have been unanswered by the developer. Chose to go through Google Pay for refund. Thanks Any.do! This will not be my last review.

"I've been trying to figure out how to have a custom time set for the ""add notification"" options, and there doesn't seem to be any way. For example, I need to set it to 1 hour and 30 minutes, but there's no option for that. We need the ability to enter exactly the number of minutes and hours we want, instead of only having presets.  EDIT: Now after using it for a while, the app has been plagued with reliability issues. It often is late with the notification by a few minutes, or the service completely stops and I'd have to restart the service. Due to this issue, I cannot rely on this app for anything that is time-sensitive because I'd end up being late for all my appointments and jobs. I've contacted the developer multiple times about this but so far they haven't been able to fix the issue."

Hello! I love the app as the tree is cute and creative. However my tree doesn't die when i press the homescreen button for forest.

"It talks about Habit building, but in effect it doesn't help much, apart 
from giving very subtle reminders of tasks which, to me, were fairly easy 
to ignore. It doesn't really push oneself to break free of lethargy or 
other excuses which we usually end up giving for not keeping a habit, apart 
from few motivational text snippets. I would like to request you that as 
this app is named HabitBull, you need to Please make it act like a bull. It 
should lead (and at times force) the users to do the right thing. A little 
more aggressive approach to habit building is what could really help."

I had a great experience but i gave 4 stars because the time is only for 25 minutes and again we have to open our phone to set a new timer and get distracted.. The best thing abt this app is that it has very relaxing sounds that help us to focus and concentrate on anything which we do ... I would be really happy if u increase the timer to 1 or 2 hrs ... Thanks
So glad I`m finally done with finals!
"Not too good for Android! I have the App in my two different type of phones and subscribed for the premium one month in my Android and found out that that version doesn't have all the features described as for example impossible to find or use the sub task feature, create or editing folders, etc. etc. Very disappointed about that, because the App concept seems to me very good. :("

It has almost everything that I need but the thing that frustrates me the most is the calendar view. That's really the most important thing to see how many days you've tracked in a row. Switch to calendar view it looks just like a regular calendar and nothing is highlighted for anything. You have to click on each individual day to see what it looks like.

"Despite various updates to ""fix bugs"" the first few screens of this app are still completely broken on Android. The app beyond sign-in still functions...but that's it. The game aspect is weak, the app isn't very well designed, and the tutorials tend to be broken on Android as well. I prefer apps like Fabulous, which I think approaches the subject of mental health and habit forming in a much better way."

"Hey, thanks for the follow, wow this is exciting a new tweet."
Bummer- that is a bad experience.
A very good Pie chart graphical view of your schedule with nice colours and everything is good about the app specially the graphical side. I'm not a pro owner but also rating 4 stars because of the glitch in app today. My whole sector were invisible today and it just showed blue colour filled circle with only an area of 45° looking as faded blue. And nothing else was there. I also have screen shot of the error if developers need it. Else it's a great app. Soon will buy the pro version.
the idea behind it its very good but it wont even let me log in...
I def will. If anyone leaves the room for a second he has to follow. He`s a really great dog otherwise so far.

I would give it ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ... if the developers added new features such as: *more affordable $20/year *more stickers: love variety *journaling pages : customizable to be added anywhere within the planner *fully customizable upcoming event pages: to help plan for weddings, anniversaries, birthdays, graduations, parent to be planning & baby or adopted child showers, Valentine's, marriage proposal 😊"

"I actually really like this app but one of the biggest features that needs to work properly for my routines is repeating reminders. I set reminds for monthly bills such as rent, and set it to repeat ""monthly"". But when I complete the task, it uncompletes itself the very next day WITHOUT setting the reminder to the next month. Basically if i set it to November 1st, it tries to remind me again, daily, on november 1st. It doesn't work. I love the app but the most important feature is broken sadly."

Absolutely amazing. The only planner app I can actually successfully use. I'm really bad with these and my brain seems to like this one's straightforward interface.
"I agree with a previous user that recent updates are making the app worse. I've used this app for several years and loved that my to-do list syncs across devices, but recent changes (specifically, deleting completed tasks instead of leaving them visible/able to be restored, despite modifying settings) make this app basically useless for my purposes. I'm disappointed that I need to find a new app after so long using this one."

It's a great app to stay focused but sometimes I use my phone to go on Google or use Google translate or dictionary and other things that I need to do my work. I think the app should let us choose which apps can be an exception because phones are sometimes very important in doing our work. Restrict only games and social media.

Because of the glitch, I have missed a bus a couple times b/c the timer didn't ring. I am displeased. Also the new updates seem unoriginal"

"Some pretty basic standard features in other apps are missing. The options menu is very limited with no option to default a tasks due date, project, category etc. These have to be entered every single time a task is created which makes adding quick tasks on the fly very annoyingly slower than other apps. There is no sorting options or filters on views (ability to create custom views does not exempt this feature from being useful). Too many clicks to edit tasks, eg notes/comments, rescheduling."

very frustrating, because the sorting feature is buggy. Sometimes the item

them is an essential feature for me. I'm on Android 6.0 (LG G4)."

It gives the option to add a local calendar but doesn't let you use it unless you also give permission to use a Google or Outlook calendar. Kind of defeats the purpose of doing a local-only calendar if I can't actually use it.

"Disappointing... I have been happily using this application for years now, but the last few updates appear to have caused more problems than they fixed. One example: when you create an event that's further away than a month, the app will AT ALL TIMES change the date and time to incorrect ones. It has done this EACH time for me over the last months, changing the dates and times for no reason; you can imagine this is a deal-breaker for a planning app..."

"Funciona bien, pero si le hacen falta cosas, tengo la versión premium, resulta que debería existir la opción de crear categorías (donde uno pueda seleccionar el ícono que más le convenga de la lista que ustedes dejen y poder asignarle el nombre de la categoría) por ejemplo: como sabemos, existe categoría denominada ""study"" pero no se puede configurar mas de ahí. Sería bueno poder crear categorías con el nombre de cada materia para tener un mejor control de lo que se HACE."
"Homework bound for the whole weekend, not so fun"
Good app. I use it to daily to keep track of everything. It works well.

Not worth it don't buy...
"This calendar would be a 5 star except for 1 MAJOR issue. The sync is unreliable. For example, items placed on my calendar via Google or Gmail within the previous 24-48 hours usually do not appear no matter what sync settings I have or how many times I manually initiate a manual sync. All other calendar apps I have tried do not have these sync issues."
It work absolutely fine but why every hour try to connect with Facebook servers? Adguard noticed it
"I'm liking it so far. It's a very customizable experience, and I can really get into the details without the interface being too complex. I would like to see more widget options for the ap on the home screen. I like to see my schedule and routine the moment I open my phone. While there is a widget, it's rather lack luster. Synced with the programming, I think it would be cool if they had a calendar widget available."
Going to workout + swin... fun

_Kid congrats; im still jobless
"It would be nice if there was a warning what certain buttons do. I was trying to figure out how to change the day from day one, clicked clear day, and it erased my entire schedule. It should say clear routine if that's what it does. I'm a little pissed as I just paid for the app so I can make a schedule. Still unsure of how to do what I need."
no instructions..
Boring starting work weekend soon................ 1st need to get a Tim Coffee so I can make it through this **** night shift........
Ship. I`m stuck.
"Work day 7 of 7,"
the app requires premium membership to use the widget. defeats the point for me

"You can add one thing, when we'll touch on particular time period then the particular task should be displayed."
just made a South-Korean email pal. Happy!
Too much advertisement. Not motivating nor relaxing
I had 2 hoes .. now I have none
This app is so cool! It really helps me to motivate my self and I love the sounds it does in the background! Highly reccomend!
"It's really only useful if you are doing recurring tasks at the same time, on the same days, etc. I set up a lot of tags (categories) but they can only be applied to the routines, not events or reminders. I was also not able to copy/duplicate events, which would have allowed me to reuse the same tasks at different times or days without setting up a brand new event. Disappointed in the app's scheduling capabilities."
"Very fun and a good way to stay focused. I do recommend this app. The sounds come broken sometimes, it should be fixed."
aww
"saw kim kardashian on robertson today, ate a hella good sandwich at bay cities in santa monica, and just downloaded a lot of new songs"
"I tried it years ago and never really got it going. Then I switched to Wunderlist and became an organized machine! Now Wunderlist is being retired, so I thought I'd try again, guessing it would be much better by now and that my ability to use it to my advantage would be vastly improved. Nope. No ability for folders or some other way to group lists together so I don't have to flip through all my lists to find the one I want. Not even a list view to make them easier to find."
Chemistry is not fun..
Playing some games before I leave for work   Work til at least 11PM tonight.
App has so many problems. I started experiencing them once I paid for the pro version. No one has responded me back from the support to solve my issues. Some issues are as below. 1. Not fully supporting the app whitelist which is a big obstacle in working. 2. Not counting the exceeded time even after setting it up again and again. 3. Took so long to log in after reinstallation as I tried that to solve the above mentioned issues. My advice : Don't pay for this app till these issues are resolved
awwwww i`m such a scifi geek and StarWars is the TEN COMMANDMENTS for us geeks!!
"i love this app but it reads my texts. i left one in draft and it suggested it as a Todo item. i couldn't find any way to get it to keep is ""eyes"" to itself. not about it."

"I uninstalled the app and installed it again and now the app works, but ive lost all my progress and my forest... this is so dumb this app forces me to uninstall and then i dont even get my progress back"

"Is working as described.

It has been a useful app so far."

Excellent concept which has huge potential.  Only problem is that the hour hand does not keep time correctly in 24 hour time. It shows 1400 instead of 1600 (2 hour difference).
i`m bored : hope your wlan will go today!
"Very useful, and it syncs accross all of my devices. This is now my must have app"

"lol, I`ve just realised that i`ve been sending messages that were meant to be to you, to a page that doesn`t exist"
Great!
Felt very complicated when i am flying high.
Excellent. The best to do app out there.
"Crippled version without even a way to purchase outright. EDIT: I'll be clearer. Many apps features are disabled. But there is no way to just buy the app. The only option is some ongoing payment subscription which makes no sense as this app does not provide any ongoing or backend service, it's just an app! and a simple one at that. It's like going to buy a water bottle and going to check out they take your credit card info and charge you the same price every year that you use the bottle. Bottom line, it's just a scummy business practice."
"Very pleasant to work with, although it would be nice to have sub-skills that are part of a more general skill, for example a specific language that is part of languages in general, and the option to rank up high level skils, for example begginer(insert topic here) at level 100 evolves to adept(insert topic here) and goes down to level 1."

"The app is not working well since the latest update (2.37.0): the app crashes a lot when creating or editing tasks, the reminder for tasks and meeting are not working (notifications are enabled), so that makes the app useless. Reinstalling the app doesn't solve anything."

"Very interesting concept but it's extremely time consuming to setup and add all the content you need. Also being able to edit everything and choose the rewards freely kinda looses it's purpose. I understand some people might like the feature, but I personally do not. Overall, great app if you have the time to set it up and get familiar with it."

"those cakes sure look good ,,took one if it`s ok with you  ummm good tks"
Just downloaded the app better review later on
Great concept. Reminders do not work and from some quick research it appears this has been an issue for literal years now. I was really hoping I could have the app remind me of tasks instead of setting a hundred alarms on my phone. I'd prefer not to have both. I'd really appreciate if reminders would actually work.
I remember the days when you bought an app and owned it.. Now every developer wants to lock you into a lifetime subscription process where they can charge you for eternity. I simply refuse to rent my own notepad.
I look forward to having one very soon
I`m proud of You Solange.

I had given 5 stars in Jun 2017. I'm changing it to 1 star because of the full screen ads which cannot be dismissed. I'm grateful to the developer for creating this nice looking calendar app and was happy to tolerate the ads in the free version but the full screen ads really disrupt the process of adding an event to the point where it becomes intolerable. I'll just switch to Google calendar which syncs better anyway. Thanks for the few years of a great app.

"Great app BUT it takes away access to your data after a while unless you grant full access to email addresses/google acct/ everything. Fair enough request, but not by holding data to ransom. Either that or its been compromised by malware, but I don't think so"
"This app is wonderful, but I am having problems with the things linking to the network. I have a good internet and have tried restarting the app several times, however I can't seem to connect to the shop for my in game currency and the real forest things. It says unable to connect, I'm just saying this in case, I'll check with support"

Happy Friday. Just pulled some yummy radishes out of the garden. Hope the strawberries turn out. Still no blooms.
"The app is a great concept helping me keep track of goals and be motivated to do the things I need to in a day. Friendly competition and cooperation keep things interesting and encouraging. Quests are wonderful long term motivation, along with the goal of filling the stable. It is discouraging, frustrating and hurtful when I try to check off dailies (or do ANYTHING on the app) and it doesn't let me because of connection failures. I lost health overnight because it didn't let me check off my dailies? Especially frustrating during quests. Myself and friends all have the ""connection problems"" in different locations on data, or wifi at the same time... Fixes are quick, and interactions/responses pleasant! Great app!"
"Boo, on both counts."

"Have been looking for a way to incorporate the elements of gaming into making progress ""In Real Life"". Even tried inventing something for myself but paper tracking was a nightmare and having it in this app is just fantastic! Really like it and it has made a big difference! The only reason I took it down a star is because it depletes my phone battery really fast if I am in the app for very long, such as when I am shopping or browsing challenges, so I do these things mostly on my PC. Overall, great job! Would recommend this to anyone that enjoys gaming but is struggling with motivation in the real world."
"About to pik out my hair, braid it up, scrub off my make up and relaxxxx.... tonight was fun"
"It has very nice, useful and comfortable look, I used it with a pleasure. Unfortunately synchronization with gmail calendar stopped working. Tried to reinstall this app - it helped for a week and stopped working again."
"Doesn't show character customisation, think it needs an update"
"It doesn't crash, OFTEN, great interface, and easy to create an event and/or task list. Don't change a thing."

Why doesn't this to-do list app work with natural language? In most others you can write 'at 12pm do x and y!' and you'll get a task added automatically.

"Excelent app, use it daily. Sortable tasks, sortable sub tasks, many reminder options. See only what you need to do today, or this week, or customize date using widget. Paid version is worth it too. I have had the servers go down a couple of times in the last few months, may change rating of it becomes a regular problem."

"Sorry, not Impressed I'm sorry to leave a poor review, but I thought it best to let the developers and others know I had so many challenges with it I wouldn't know where to begin. :( UPDATE: Although I initially gave the app a one star, I upgraded to two because their response was kind and professional. They asked for details of the challenges I had with the app and were genuinely pleasant to correspond with. So if you have a complaint, share kindly because they really do care. :)"
Cool layout very easy. Push notifications aren't working so it doesn't remind me at the time I tell it too but can't figure why I allowed notifications so probably a bug.
That`s exactly how I feel.  I hope you start feeling better soon.
Damn you North Korea. http://bit.ly/KtMeQ

Look like they let me put in a lot of dataand then after a certain point decide to hold that data the hostage until I paid them. I decided to not use any.do because after I pay them and started making more list, would they suddenly didn't demand that I paid them more per month in order to access all the information I had taking the time to put in?"
How was your chicken and chips?
"Customer support is completely unresponsive. I purchased the upgraded version and it doesn't sync as promised. There has been no help on FB, email, nada. Kinda sucks TBH. The app is nice.

"DON'T BUY PREMIUM! You have to pay for an entire year upfront. And If you change your mind about the app, like I did, due to its odd inconsistent behavior with reaccuring tasks and reminders. You're given 48 hours after the 7 day trial to qualify for a refund. After that you're screwed. All most all of the issues started happening after that period ended. They obviously know they have problems with the app, just read their robotic responses to issues. ANY.DO HIDES BEHIND TOS INSTEAD OF HELPING"

"The app per se is good. Sadly the customer service when you have an issue is no where to be found. For about a month i have sent emails since the app after an update went back to basic, even after paying the pro version about 3 years ago. No help has been provided after all this time. In my view, you can make it or break it when you take care of your paying customer or ignore him. It seems like they dont see it that way. Perhaps now they will pay attention."

This app has really helped me organize my schedule and block out my routines that don't fit into other time blocks and have smaller increments of type that are hard to see in other calendar apps. I would recommend using for morning and evening routines.

"Theres always something shifty to me about an app that shouldnt need a subscription for doing the absolute minimum. They make setting reminders too complicated and they're hoping you forget to end your free trial before they start doing automatic payments, that's just how most of these apps work. You're better off setting an alarm on your phones clock and having that on repeat than you are using this."
Well for one thing I might be branded a 'public menace' by the state.

"Every other month, I think I'll do better. I try again. I download this app. Everything gets back in order, so I uninstall it to free up space in my storage. Then I relapse. I download the app again. This is a never ending cycle of desperation, loss, and hope. I will always download this app. I will always uninstall it. 9/10 would recommend"
Good set of features. Works well. Only wish I could display tasks or reminders on the Calendar without a time duration.

"It seems like a good app but I haven't found a way to enable a permanent notification for quick task adding. Is it only possible? EDIT: No, I mean a permanent notification that works like your widget, allowing to quickly add new tasks without opening the app. SplenDO and Any. Do have this feature for instance."

"This app is just excellent! A truly powerful task and project manager. Don't be filled by its apparent simplicity - there are a lot of features and flexibility hidden in this little gem. Try it out! What I would like added though is if the My Day planning feature can be extended so I can plan for the next day, not only the same day, so I can populate my following day's My Day view in the evening before going to bed, instead of having to wait to plan on the morning only."

"Great idea and I'm enjoying it so far. Chores and errands are much more fun. My one gripe so far is that it seems like most items/quests cost gems, which are pay to play. I'm afraid i'll pretty quickly run out of free items/quests to strive for and then the app will lose its effectiveness. It'd be helpful if their were other ways to unlock gems outside of paying for them, like reaching extra high levels of productivity/habit building, etc."

Nice app It helps a lot to save time. You will understand where you used more time and where you should spend more time.
_INTHEMAKING :aw
Airsoft is horrible!! Hope you didn`t get hurt
Fantastic app but 4 stars. Every part has been a comfortable experience for me until I started trying to use it across devices. I took me around 30 minutes to set up all my tasks the first time and when I signed into my account for the app all the tasks I had made got overwritten by the default tasks from the other device. It was partially my fault for the careless order that I signed in on the devices. But perhaps my issue could have been avoided entirely if when it attempted to sync my tasks from the internet the first time it asked me if I wanted to use the database that is from the internet or that is local. Would have saved me a lot of headache remaking all the tasks again. That said every other function provided is great and I would recommend.
Hello there! Thankyou. I always seem to make a difference in  someone`s life everyday.
just watched it on youtube and its hilarious. i laughed trough it.. seriously guys so funny.. greetings from Germany...
I really love the idea this app has but it has some bugs. The first 2 pages are blank and when i had to make my character everything was blank too. After updating the app it was still the same. (Im using a samsung s8 if thats important) Hope you guys fix it cuz i'd love to use the app.
i love love love silverstein.  work tomorrow. boo!

I really love this free app. It's so cool to see my schedule visually and know how much time I have until the next event. The only thing I would change (and this may already be available in the paid version) is the ability to choose different colors for each event.

"great so far, it would be nice to allow the 5 buttons on the widget have an option to skip a day, week or month forward or backward, if i would like to look ahead i have to open one or two apps when it could be a button you set on the widget. maybe even a button option that allows one widget to switch between multiple calendars, just thought id include that suggestion."
aaahh i know!! i was spose to but i had to take my dad to the airport.  next weeek fasho!
"oh, coo; i was suppose to be an intern too!  but dangit, SAT. :| so how`s the intern life? haha"
"After installing and uninstalling several other apps I finally found this one and it suits my needs the best. I like the appearance and all the features. There are two things I'm missing however - subtasks and the possibility to tick off every single completed task or event for the specific day. This would make this app a perfect tool for me and I wouldn't mind to pay for it. As a busy mom battling depression I need a simple tool to help me to organise my day and week, and to remember my tasks."
you guys ROCKED IT tonight in LA!! Love ya guys and cab wait to see another awesome show soon

"Just upgraded to Android 10. Re-evaluating. So far so good. Though pop ups are gone due to Android 10 architecture, I don't miss them. Reminders are now handled through the Android Notifications platform. Thankfully, the multiple reminders feature still works; I personally think this is the most important feature that makes this app better than stock calendar apps and even MS Outlook."
ahaha its stuck in my head; thanxx
"just got up, smoking a cig and drinking coffee.. i need to start working on my final project for the univ"
"Thank you. I love the app and it's helping me immensely already.

It would feel much more meaningful that way and serve as additional motivation."

"The app is good to use overall. Except, as a number of other folks have said, it does not sync. And there is no response from the developer on this issue. Annoying to have paid for an app that claimed the sync feature, when it doesn't actually work. What that means is you lose all history every time you change the phone."

E.g. i want to make it so i start at level 40 in benchpress and achieving 91kg will put me at level 41. I will reach level 100 in benchpress by the time i can do 150kg, completing 120kg would put me on level 70 etc.  Otherwise the numbers are just meaningless to me. Really i want to set it up so when i reach my goal in each thing i am at level 100."

My new ""go to"" task manager and calendar. Great job, devs!"
App doesn't have pop up notifications anymore for my tasks that I set a reminder at a certain time for. I have checked the app permissions and it allows full notifications.
"Finally home, watching saturday night live, then dreaming about my amanda boo"
"Came back to see if I can use the app since I do like it, it's a great idea. I'm my case: I need to be able to add calendar events, reminders in one app 100% essential and afaik this isn't supported? I have a shared gcal, a personal and another work one and all of them needs to not only show up for me to organize life itself. They also need to be managed in the app I use for reminders etc for this to do what it needs for me. Not just reminders, calendar events needs add, edit. Back to any.do"

"Could be a great app except that like another user said, it does not sync between devices when the description claims that it can. That's a big letdown for me because when used any other of my devices, and when I switched phones, I couldn't sync the app up with my data or any habits I've been tracking, even though I have the premium account. When attempting to sync It always says that there is no internet connection, but there always is. So I can't give it a full 5/5 rating, otherwise I might."

The app is great. I wanted to use this app as a way to help me to creat a better habit and staying on track with certain things. For me the notifications don't work unles I open the app and by that point its like my reminders have passed.. other then that easy app to use and navigate.

"Switch to 'to do' because wunderlist is being discontinued. It is a lovely app, easy to navigate interface. However, the function of 'today' smart list is not integrated. In wunderlist, this is the hat I was working from. It would be great to see 'today' smart list again! By the way, ""My day"" smart list doesn't automatically pick up the day's tasks, instead you have to add them. 🤷‍♀️"

"Ex happy Wunderlist user, disgruntled with this half-baked attempt. Most of the fine details that made Wunderlist great were omitted (with an option to include them at some vague point in the future), interface does look cleaner but there are fewer details that help tasks being organized visually. For a standalone app it would deserve a 3 star. For an app that is supposed to replace Wunderlist it would get a 2 star. For an app that tries to get users by killing it's better competitor, even a 1 star is too much."

"I'm trying to develop some healthy habits, and this app is very good at reminding me to do things. The only complaint I have is that you can't actually organize your tasks and habits. I try to organize them by time and they don't move. I have a habit for 12pm listed after one for 3am, which is preceded by 4pm. This is very frustrating when you want to look at things in order. That's why I'm docking 1⭐. I like the function of it and I like the widget. Update: 1⭐ restored- thank you for helping!"
"Lovely night, guys. Full moon  thinking about going out onto my roof lol"

This app has some major problems. It seemed to work fine for the first day of running. After the first day no reminders were executed. Any game armor or weapons could never be equipped. it appeared you could equip them but once you left the screen they become unequipped and they never showed up on the avatar. I mainly got this app for productivity and since the reminders do not work I'm not certain I'm going to continue using it unless these problems are fixed.
Congratulations to Manny 'Pacman' Pacquiao! You`ve made every Filipino proud of being a Filipino!

"I'm just starting out with Habitica and am liking it so far, but the To-Dos would be much more useful if they could be organized by due date. I've got like 25 things on that list, with due dates over the next two weeks or so, and it would be much easier to actually accomplish these things if I could easily see which were the most urgent instead of having to scroll up and down and compare dates in a mental tally."

"Very Nice App ... But who really needs to be reminded of and check off things we do all the time in daily life? If something is important next week or whenever, we normally remember it without fail - or we write it down. This App, while very nice indeed, typifies and feeds society's obsession with mobiles and tablets - and it renders people even more stupidly 'dependent' upon help - instead of what used to be 'common sense.' 🤔"

I had a premium. Scam.The app is very pushy and annoying. I couldn't get into 80% of my incoming calls as it blocked the screen so the call doesn't appear on the screen. You only hear it and hopelessly looking for the call screen that you only get once the call is dropped. You have to call back then. Disturbing and annoying. I barely used this app as to maintain it takes a lot of time. I asked them to cancel they said they will not refund as more than 48h passed of yearly(!) subscription.

TickTick has helped ease the mental load of remembering them all, and it's more useful than a paper list as your phone is always handy. I think I even sleep better because I have less stress about keeping up with tasks. It's easy to reschedule tasks that you don't get to on a given day. I also enjoy the habit-forming function!"
Notifications are not working properly. It pop's up only when I open the app. 😕😕😕

Stop looking at users as cash cows. I will be uninstalling this and moving to a different app which is as good and does not nag. This is quite a good To Do app other than that it too often comes up with prompts to upgrade to the premium subscription-based version. Since when have customers disrespectfully/greedily been treated as cash cows. It used to be apps were$5 at most for a lifetime of use but now they are greedy and arrogant enough to want $5 or thereabouts per Month! I wud pay a one off
"The new update remove the option to change only one event when it is on repeat, now i need to copy and select.. And could have more colors!! Paid version"
.. .great.. you can buy me lunch when i get my 10-15% pay cut next month..
This app is great. It keeps me on track with things i need to do! Works great for me and i dont have any major problems at all.
"Regardless of my free version this app's intention is to help it's users increase positive habits and reduce negative habits. For someone like me who needs feedback, the percentage of success gives me an incentive and motivates me to keep the chain going. After using this app for almost two months I have been able to analyze and critique a few of the apps features. It would be interesting to know scientific statistics of the success of the app and if it is successful in what it is set out to do. In regards to the level of engagement I would say that the percentage strategy keeps me coming back to this app. For functionality, the free version runs smoothly, is clear, and easy to use. For aesthetics, it is simple and convenient however I do think that for some users it might be difficult to see due to size of buttons and font size. The information is a bit outdated and needs to be cited and should come from more credible sources. I do enjoy seeing that there is a discussion board for communication between users. From my subjective analysis this app's rating is a 4.1."

The android homescreen widget keeps on hanging every now and then. I'd have to remove the widget and then add it again to the home screen to make it work. It's really a headache. I may opt out of the app if the widget continues to behave like this. Google calendar was what I was using before and that worked completely fine.

"I regret buying this app. (TL;DR: don't use this app if you ever intend on changing routines or planning.) Changing existing routines is very hard as it simply deletes whatever overlaps in time. So unnecessary and impossible to revert. If you accidentally click PM instead of AM once, your whole day is deleted permanently. Also, every time I want to sync between my phone and my tablet I have to export it to Google Drive and then import it from the other device. Also, you can't copy items or days to another time. Please make this app more user friendly!"

I really like must of the app but it has 2 horrible bugs that made me uninstall it. Whenever I make a new event in the widget it places it a day after the date that I chose and then the edit button doesn't work and you are stuck with it and it might get confusing. I might download it again if that is fixed.

Apparently I rated this app one star this time last year but I don't remember what the issue was so whatever you guys did up to now with improving  the app is good. Unfortunately I'm heavily dependent on having a calendar view(not Google calendar integration but rather an option to display days via calendar) so until it's put into the app I will be uninstalling and standing by for the update.

Personally I absolutely love this app and it is exactly mathematically what I have been looking for. The only true inconvenience is that once the day is over you cannot go back and add tasks to a day. Developers could you pretty pretty pretty please with sugar on top make it possible for us to go back and add tasks that we have completed on previous days!?! Maybe in the calendar area or something! Thank you kindly! 🙏❣️ Revision: 5 star! Thank you for responding and teaching me hot to edit task!

It is very good app to manage your to do list. One thing that can make it better is it should show all the incomplete or overdue taks with todays tasks as overdue instead of into inbox. This will make those task more accessible and will keep them under notice.

Reported so many times and uploaded every data they asked for but in vain. 1 star is for that !!!! I purchased premium and now I've to go through all this."

Actually maybe not - it`s sold out for Sat lunch
Pfft. FAN THIS *helicopters imaginary penis* ....  HI DRAKE! WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD!!!
This is a great application to view the events in your day. Easier to see compared to the traditional calendar app. One improvement that I would like to see is the ability to see future events by pressing on the widget itself instead of going into the application.
I know it`s just a sprain. It`s a repetitive injury for me.
Excellent app

Resulta incómoda y da pereza usarla. Falta mucho por mejorar. La actualización automática de mi día hace muchísima falta y básicamente uno se tiene que acostumbrar a la app en vez de que a uno le guste.
Have spent half of the day troubleshooting something that wasn`t even within my control. Clusters doesn`t always mean high availability.

"I love everything about this app, except for how it handles snoozing repeat tasks. It's easy to use and has a lot of configuration, something a lot of other apps save for the premium version. Unfortunately, I find it unusable due to how snoozing repeat tasks then alters the date/time for all future occurrences, making it difficult to manage these tasks when I just want to snooze it this one time. If this was changed I would give 5 stars and upgrade to premium as the app is otherwise perfect."

"This app would be so much better if it didn't penalize you for doing your habits for many days in a row. Instead of getting more experience, coins, you get less the longer you do something. You should be rewarding the habits that people are building, not telling them that once they have the Habit they're going to get less for it. Otherwise, this app would get five stars for me."

"This app has greatly helped me in creating better study habits and eliminating procrastination (I'm a high school senior for reference). Part of the reason is because, rather than simply completely blocking usage of apps, it allows you to choose to break your streak, forcing you to actually consider the consequences of procrastinating. My only gripe is that I feel like the ability to whitelist apps should be free (although it is only around $3, which isn't bad). I'd recommend it to anyone."

"The app will put by default new tasks into Inbox but Inbox is not what you see when opening Todoist. Instead you might see that there are no tasks for the next 7 days. There's no logic in it, app's assistant integrated with Google Assistant fails to find any tasks, even if asked specifically about those in Inbox. Todoist is cumbersome and annoying, it's actually a general problem with task apps: they're too much and fail to actually do what they are made for."

"I like the new ""Jump Day"", and ""Insert Gap"" options, and the Advice/Delay dialog for multiple activities. The Undo feature is a great addition as well. I'm really disappointed with the new look and that vertical scrolling through. Makes it so much harder to use - it's easier to start changing the wrong day since the current activity is not highlighted in any way, and starting time is not that clear as before. Also, those activity/free time blocks take too much space, yet there is not enough space horizontally for the text and a lot of the additional tags aren't visible. I'd prefer a more compact look. It would take a lot of time getting used to this..."

Best app for daily Routine but there are some issue such as you can get lot of coins and increase your level to infinit though settings. You should improve that because Some one donot get motivated for doing task when you knew that you can change your level.

You keep opening wundelist because of its user friendly interface and functions and the opposite is true with DO IT.

"I do like this widget a lot however I left two stars blank for very specific features. First and most importantly I left a star empty for the ability to display battery status on the widget as I use this as my primary smartwatch face. Thus without this feature it is very hard for me to see the status of my battery at a glance and know when I should try to get a little bit of charging. The second feature is integration with Outlook calendar without asking for permission for the entire account if it needs to ask for permissions at all, as my workplace has very high security requirements. For each of these features implemented I will add another star."

And maybe a proper/separate friends list :)"

"Its a to do list that can go everywhere with you and no writing! Can prioritize list as well great little app 11/2019 edit- hoping like other folks that they undo the changes. This app has gotten more difficult and counterintuitive with the last update. Used to be able to select multiple items to reschedule at one time. Can't do that anymore. Also used to be able to just type repeat everyday, repeat every Monday Wednesday and Friday etc. It now seems like only sometimes that works."
haha it will be interesting haha

_Foster Just so i can see how they look with the other icons. Both themes btw.
This game is a great way to get things done. I love the idea of not being able o leave the app or your tree will die. I consider this a great tool as I am homeschooled.
"Great habit tracking app. The only things I think could be improved are: goal dates not automatically pushing back to match the day you edited a habit. And being able to edit how you want to track a habit if you change your mind. Maybe I missed something, but it seems like you have to recreate a habit in order to change how to keep track of it (ex. Yes/No or by keeping count with numbers). I highly recommend this tool though, it's a great place to start keeping track of habits!"

App cannot keep track of an atypical. Everytime I set the day one it just resets after day 5 back to day one. instead of skipping two days and then 2 day 1 like a normal week would work. I'm deleting this app for sure.

Missing key features cross platform
Over complicated
"Full screen ads ruin it all I've been using this since it was just ""business calendar"". It was still $7 back then so I wouldn't buy it but would click the ads every now and then. Now with the full screen ads it's practically unusable. Also, before the dev comes in with the stock ""the free version has ads"" response: no duh it has ads. We didn't pay for the app because its upfront cost is too high so we liked the corner ads. Now you force them to take over our screens. Uninstalled and 1-Star."
"All the activities planned or unplanned for today should appear under ""My Day""..."

"Nearly Perfect! This app has replaced at least three other apps I used to have on my phone. It's a great utility that forms part of my everyday life. Accompanied by an affordable pricing model and not the ""money hungry"" ideology that so many mobile app devs have these days, it's nearly perfect. I would love to be able to link a habit to a task and see a view of habit progress. Like chaining in other habit apps. Keep up the great work!"
Excellent time management and gives you a real sense of your day. I would however had liked to be able to change dates to see how other days are looking.
it is really different and essential idea But unfortunatly In my phone you can come out of the app without destroying your tree

This could be in a form of a pie, bar, or line chart. You can include all so we have a choice. With this anyone can now keep track of time spent on a daily activity and limit time spent on said activity. So far good work work guys."

This one is very beautiful but its tree texture is not beautiful.
Many times i've used the app for over 65 minutes and every time it'd just freeze and shut down when only 1 second is left. Doesn't plant the tree and doesn't give me the coins. I'm disappointed + upset that i still can't save up for the treehouse that i want.

I loved TT and paid for Premium but sooner or later their reminder will let you down :( You can't count on it unfortunately. And it's not because of Android but due to a flaw in the app. If a reminder pops up and you accidentally tap somewhere else in the screen or if you're busy now then the reminder disappears and never reminds you again until you manually find this task again in the list and set a new date for the reminder.

"This initially looks a bit confusing. However, this design actually functions extremely well. The way it can act as both a clock, date, alarm and agenda widget at the same time is just incredibly efficient. It also provides you with a very easy way to evaluate at which times of the day you have events and more importantly: when you have breaks and how long they are. All this at a glance, compared to clunky agenda widgets where you have to sit and calculate it in your head. Well worth the money!"
"It could be great but too hard to delete an item on your agenda. It's like you put it on your agenda and it just doesn't disappear after it's over it just keeps on repeating very annoying sad that I paid the full subscription amount thinking it would help me to stay focused with my work day, but only for a few days until it started repeating itself and I tried to find a way to cancel or delete something out of the agenda completely"
rest well!
"This was originally a 5 star app, but now you can only use it by allowing it access to either your emails or Facebook! 😡😡😡 I am definitely not happy to allow this so have deleted the app. Would give it zero stars if I could."

"Another simple app with a subscription plan... This is not the right strategy to attract more people... This kind of app should be a one time payment no more. Whatever the number of apps with this strategy, it doesn't make it a good one."
Hats off to a slightly unexpected yet very successful end to a grouling day!!! Night all
is chatting to one of her besties.
I find the concept of this app absolutely stupid I don't think people are gonna care about if a virtual plant dies if u use an app and the only thing it does is give u a notification as an incentive. What the app should do is whenever someone opens an app forest should open and display over the app this will prevent others from casually using other apps while their work is in progress.
"It's helpful, but it's also annoying. Edit: I didn't make it clear enough, it's annoying to realize how much I'm failing lol Anyway the app is pretty good I'm just overly sensitive and self criritcal"
thanks  night
Easy to set up and edit. I upgraded to premium so I could add more habits.
Once installed the app was showing another time zone.
"I have had this app for 2 years and absolutely loved it, after an update it would cut on automatically and freeze my phone. I would have to hit the open apps and close it before I could do anything with my phone. I have emailed and explained what it was doing, and I get am email wanting more explanation, so I did. several days later I get an email that wants a video showing. I don't think this will get fixed i paid for the pro version and i will not renew"

"Good app, could be better"
Ever since the recent updates.. the app clash and wont work as the PLANT button were pressed .. unless the Wifi/ Mobile data were on.. it works fine. I would give 0 zero star if I could.. running an app in internet connection can be interrupting especially for students. Please fix this issue as I'm wishing to depend on the app with no internet connection (as how it used to in last version)
I see no difference in this and Google calendar
Yeah I`m okay been icing and ace bandage and sitting on my **** on twitter... LOL Thanks
"Pretty decent to-do app, with probably the least annoyances of the very many I've tried over the years. I'm yet to find my perfect match though. The app sometimes require unnecessarily many taps to get something done. It's easy enough to understand, it's just not the smoothest user experience."
"I do like the straight forwardness of this system it does what it says on the tin, needs to keep developing but in the theme it's in if it gets to clever like some systems it will loss it's position"
"I love this app, I tried a lot of apps and choose this because the alarm sound function, if this app can have the challenge friends functions, it will really good more. But for now, everything is perfect."
Please add folders. Wanderlust has folders. It's an important feature for me otherwise theres too much lists to manage.
No I haven`t had chance to watch that yet...going to have to get hold of it.   Thanks for the tip.

This app has helped me a lot and is all in all one of the best apps I know. There's just one suggestion: I have many habits and dailies hence I have to scroll a lot. It would be amazing if there was an option to change the layout so you can have a better overview.
aww i feel bad cause i dunno if nicole is in the city looking for me. she`s probably worried  srry hun

App seems ok. But they want you to pay a monthly fee just to use a basic calendar. It let's you view the current week. Anything else and you have to pay. So many free ones out there to choose from. Uninstalling.
Yup is ace film tho
alhamdulilah. i got accepted into nafa
The app has a way of motivating you to complete tasks.
"I made several repeating tasks that are supposed to be repeated weekly by the day of the week. They seem to just multiply and now the same 4 tasks will show up 3 times each on a single day. I can't edit the original repeating ones, I can only delete them individually on the day they show up several times. This is VERY annoying. This app was a waste of my money. I paid for the ability to make repeating tasks. I'm very disappointed."
"I've been actively using this and I love the concept. App version could really use a new UI. Dark mode would be appreciated, and maybe letting users adjust Font or size of boxes. (Feels too large right now. It would easily hold more details, but space is lost to a big box)"

I have been a subscriber of the pro version for years when this new version came out I tried it and there were problems. I tried it again and it seems to work well. I tried running with one alarm and now it dosen't stop when I acknowledge it I'm going back to the old version. I have removed pro 2 if the problem pesiststs I will have to find a new calendar. Very frustrated.
"I love Wunderlist! Unfortunately it will disappear in May 2020 and be replaced by this app. Me and my husband have installed the new app, imported all our lists from Wunderlist but we cannot share any of them, not even the ones that we previously shared in Wunderlist. I hope they will fix the problem until May."
I had so much fun tonight!! But i am soo excited to get home and go to sleep

Well the one thing where you lay on the floor I couldn`t do all of them....I`m very out of shape
Excitement: 8 new followers overnight. Sadness: 6 of them are ad bots.
The app's really nice and I really like it but it's just REALLY REALLY BUGGY for my phone. I can't switch between the calendar and tasks with ease. I can't even slash out items on the to do list smoothly. It could've been such a big game changer for how I do things!! :-(
"So helpful. Great way to keep track of tasks, notes, info, and appointments! Appreciate the cross-platform functionality ☺"
"Awesome! Was using Wunderlist, but they are going away. I tried a few others. They are all so similar now. But this one seems like it will be here for the long haul judging by the number of downloads. Also, it is as simple as Wunderlist. I did have to pay $29 and Waunderlist was free for the most important functions, so that was different. But after using the app for a week I'm sold. Not a better app out there for my purposes. KISS- keep it simple stupid. And this app does that."
Morning.. Coffee and fresh air
"Cute and entertaining, definitely helping me to stop bad habits!"
"Thank you for responding and I'm looking forward to that update (customized categories). Another improvement I'd love to see are more options for a goal besides a daily one, such as save $100 per week, etc. I got the Premium and love the dark theme, this app is the best I've found for my needs. Thank you!"
she said no
screw the fact you can`t post LONG updates on twitter
"This app is simply the best for organising yourself. It's so customisable, I really love how you can not only set exact times and dates, you can then get those reminders to repeat however you want - do you want to be reminded every second Wednesday of the month? No problem. Do you want reminders only during weekdays? Sure! Also, my love for this app has grown considerably since I found out you can set location based reminders - and you don't even have to pay for it! Fantastic app, A++"
It's an essential daily time management app.It can further improve by providing the more detailed analysis and auto suggestion for the activity based on past routines.Further the routine creation can be simplified by providing the 1 step auto update functionality along with individual task creation functionality currently provided.
what a beautiful day not to got to my first class
"Amazing app, helps me organise different tasks and events with colour codes. Wish there was a notes page and a timetable so I could keep everything in one place!"
ahh sore throat and tired. want to go back to bed. but have work
"This is a good app for forming habits. However, it is missing important functions that you'll need. For one, this is primarily a countdown timer app. It only counts down for a specified time. It would be better if I could have a stopwatch feature. I want to use this app for times I'm working out. Also, the minimum time allowed is 10 minutes. They should change this. Either way, I uninstalled. Ads suck too."
Worst app. It crashes Everytime u click on it. What to do All my seeds will be gone if I uninstall it. But this isn't my prob so why should I pay for it. FIX IT. I WANT MY FOREST BACK!!!!!!!!!!!
Hello Twitters
She has an awsome voice. Bored nothin to do i should really consider  going back to school yeah right i`d rather cry of boredom  forever
"So I assume this app is no longer supported by its owner? Last update was summer 2018 and I saw lots of negative reviews here and on twitter about owner not responding at all. Wanted to buy premium, but first checked reviews... Ugh, it looked like a really perfect app! Sad."

I also really wish I could have more than 4 habits, is there a way to do that? it's a great app, thanks so much"

Duplicating a task multiple times and then making those into subtasks seems to be the only way, but it clutters up the task list (like 8 lines so I'm reminded to drink 8 glasses of water) and then subtasks show up twice in the daily list, both within and outside of the main task. I thought the ""repeat every 1 day, 8 times"" custom setting might work, but it's a different function."
Looking for a show to turn my brain into mush so it doesn`t hurt anymore  Any good FREE online ones you know of?
Seems pretty neat but i miss one feature thst is very important for me: be able to just hit start/stop for tasks thst needs to be done for at least x minutes per day. i dont check or remember time when i start doing something.

"Started using habitica on January 1st of this year, as a new year's resolution to manage my time and habits better, and it's been a huge help. Especially love the party aspect, and the way it adds social accountability to missing or hitting targets. Very pleased, thank you for all the work that went into this app."

I really enjoy this app but it has just stopped working randomly. I tried to hatch a dragon egg and the app crashed and since then I cant access it. I have tried uninstalling the app but nothing is working. I have even tried to use the website but it doesnt keep track of my exp gained. I am very dissapointed as I really like the idea of the app.
"I had to buy this app because I need that larger widget to fit my needs, and you cannot test it out with the free version. Sadly, it's too buggy to be of any use, at least on the AIO Launcher. Still overall better than my last habits tracker, but I feel ripped off."

"Not true, you can get worse burns today... don`t forget sunscreen"
"The app continues to improve, but it lacks one feature for me... the ability to turn off the pop- up I get on my screen every morning to tell me it's ready to ""plan my day"". Let me make this clear...I don't want you to plan my day so stop telling me to do it. I've tried turning off all notifications, but no luck. And everywhere I go on the app it tries to sell me the premium upgrade.... just annoying."
"Incredible tool, awful app. I'd recommend the desktop version of this site to anyone but the app is a bug-ridden mess that overcomplicates simple functions and only works about 90% of the time."

I think this app is the best option for a to do list except that the sync is terrible. I just paid for premium and the app will not sync. During the trial the sync between android app and PC app was also very bad. If they could get the connection/sync issues fixed it would be a great app. If I can't access the premium features I paid for in the next few hours I'm going to be requesting a refund...

"Nice and simple task app, however it is missing a couple of key features that are preventing me from switching over fun my current task app. These are: 1. No ability to set multiple reminders. 2. Cannot hide tasks until a later date. For annual tasks, I do not wish to see them constantly in my to do list, I'd like them hidden until a certain date, usually 1 month before due date. Furthermore, due to the longevity of the task, I like to be reminded early and then again closer to the time."

Mostly works well as replacement for Wunderlist. Import worked well from Wunderlist. However I wish that you had a choice to automatically add new items at the top of the list instead of the bottom. You can sort by date added but then you lose your customized order of items.

The app keeps stopping and crashes suddenly. I dont unders why.
"Too much spam. Stuff that I don't care for pops up on my screen all the time and blocking those also blocked the reminders I wanted the app for. Also, too many emails. I don't want more clutter to ""organize"" my life."
Just installed and am liking it so far. I do wish there was a way to disable the quotes and better utilize that space to see more of my actual calendar. Also sub tasks would be very useful. With those changes I might actually be able to downsize the apps I use.

The app was reccomended by my CBT therapy group but I do shift work and it's not friendly for those with rotating schedules. Great for 9-5rs who have single event tasks or those who tasks always repeat at the same tone each week or month. I need my tasks to repeat on a 4 week cycle and it ended up giving me all my tasks together each week.

This app does a great job of cleaning up the Google Calendar and making it more user-friendly. I use it all the time for my business.
"I have been using this app for about a year now without any issues, so I'm definitely not fond of the new routines menu. I find that swiping from side to side for the days to be much easier and having the drag and drop feature to be more comfortable (Hope it will be implemented again soon). Also the fact that you can't move a blank time frame up and down makes it difficult to set up the routine. As I have to change the time of every item to move it down. I would prefer the old version, hopefully it all gets fixed soon."
"It does what is it says, love this app. Would there be more features like history and analytics about habits and routines etc."

"Being able to slide tasks up and down on the fly is a critical feature which needs to be brought over from Wunderlist. I plan and order my work day tasks with it and need to be able to adjust the order quickly and frequently. My wife and I also were using Wunderlist as a grocery list sharing tool. Same complaint as we like to order the list to match our path through the grocery store. I see a few people miss this option in the reviews - Without it, the app doesn't work for me."

"DO NOT BUY the premium if you need Alexa and/or Outlook to integrate like they falsely claim this ap does or you need any support from Todoist. Outlook integration has never been a synced integration, it only forwards tasks one-way & only works with limited Outlook paid platforms. They have Alexa issue notice seen only when you try to set it up, no warning before buying believing you can integrate both. No Support response yet. I want my money back. Such waste of hours. I feel scammed"
"YES!! I made the sign when i noticed it missing on Sunday! So far, no luck... It`s now Unlucky Japanese Cat..."
Sittin through this boring **** conference call... Then i get to go home n nap *{missin  alot  }*
In the mood for shrimp scampi but I don`t have vermouth.
One of the best To Do list apps I've used.
I found this app difficult to use. That's just my personal opinion. I uninstalled it and got a different one that is easier to use.
I thought i finally found my reminder :) But this app lacks 2 important aspects: 1. No possibility to sort tasks in chronological order (why ? :) ) 2. No persistent sound. Like any other rekinder app i ve met (why ? :))) ) Plus no subtasks
"It works, but i can't sync my goals with my tablet.."
Sick. With a flu like thing.
Repetition should not be a premium function
"I think this app is great, only problem is, it's very easy to close out of the app without the timer stopping and your plant dying."
http://twitpic.com/4w75p - I like it!!
"Yessum.  We`ll see how this year goes... maybe I can head back in Oct, when the rates go down. I wanted to go for my bday"
"The reminder system is not very robust, and that should be one of the most important things. I would like more than one daily reminder for everything. I will do tasks at different times of the day, thus I need reminders that are task specific. It also requires a connection in order for you to set tasks, and if you have no signal you are out of luck. I do love the idea, fix these two things and I'll reinstall."
Many critical bugs that don't get fixed within a long period of time. Also many times doesn't sync changes to specific calendar or changes on one event out of a series of events.
"Uggh everything, I`m sending you!!! I keep sending it to my Twitter. So I have to forward it to you!!! I suck at life"

Needs some adjustments. In Wunderlist if anyone made any changes to the notes it would be broadcasted to everyone or at least to the person that record within the list belonged to. We might just got back to Wunderlist.

"Wunderlist is the best for me. If you would like to change wunderlist to be Microsoft To Do, please take all wunderlist's features. In this app you don't take 3 features that important things for me. 1. Login using un Microsoft account. 2. ""All"" task menu 3. Comment feature on each list (this point so make me happy. It used for list that I shared with another person and want to share the actual condition with a comment. Please enhance this app and I will change my rate to 5 star. Thank you:)"

"absolutely tru...the horror of it still washes ovr me sometimes if i think  abt the actual last days, but the gd memories go on"
Absolutely worthless. This app runs a prohibitively clunky interface that effectively voids the promise of ease-of-life automation. Google Calendar will provide all other services promised by Any do for free with no annual subscription rate. Don't sign up for the free trial. It's not worth getting pinged for forty bucks when you decide you don't like it and forget to cancel it in time. Save your money!
Rest then. It`s your day off!

I don't get this app
"Cannot get it to stop asking me to verify the time zone. Pressed yes, kept asking. Pressed don't ask again, kept asking. Pressed no, kept asking. Finally deleted. I'll use the the one that comes with outlook. It's not as versatile but it doesn't ask me to verify my time zone every time I look at it. Especially when I ask it not to ask me again."
Not working on my chromebook. I cannot open any lists to view the contents. EDIT: Issue seems to be resolved in the latest update. Though still only giving 3 stars since this is taking over wunderlists but is still comparatively lacking in design and ease of use.
I wish I could really do that  I love having u around! Ill see what I can do.. ;) try to use that national champ pull lol
"When the screen goes off and you on your phone but did not press into an app, the tree will be killed and waste your efforts.

"This apps not suitable for my needs. The reminder keep show every day, even the task mark as 'Done' (everyday I do click 'Done' at reminder, the next day, and next day, and next day, the reminder still come up). The logic for the apps does not make sense for me (I'm not a paid subscribber)."
I think the old version is better than the latest version. Hope that there is an option to choose between the horizantal or vertical interface. The shifting of days from left/right is easier than the new one. I barely use the app since the change of interface. Ive been using this for a very long time and it was really helpful.
Just upgraded to premium version. App and Google play list subscription at $27.99. I got charged $29.84. ???
A very good apps. It helps me a lot when it comes into managing my time. I love the features where I can set time by simply typing at 8pm for example. Good job developer
Wow  That had to be difficult
"thank you, god bless im going to eaat my in in out"
can only have 5 unless you pay for premium
Works as well as Wunderlist for the most part. For shared lists though I would like to be able to disable notifications. It can get annoying when you share a list for grocery items and each deletion is sending a notification.
And it`s gone.

"Well I like the app and it truly helps me stay focused, combined with some time restriction methods it's good (although those ones are short times plus breaks), achievements are boring and not good enough, they try to make you pay for extra, but the app itself is not exciting enough to pay, the achievements are not really worth it and it's hard to unlock new trees even with pro version. No new campaigns are launched & collecting coins is not an easily achievable task, too hard to get new trees."
getting ready so i can go out
"WIDGET DOES NOT SYNC/REFRESH PROPERLY. Went back to Wunderlist until at least the widget refresh/sync issue is solved. (using android phone, tablet and windows 10). The following items, which are present in Wunderlist, should definitely be integrated: 1) The option to choose that starred items be moved to top. 2) The option to choose that new tasks be added to top. 3) Folder view in the widget 4) Icons under a task on the widget showing that a task has subtasks and/or notes in it."
The task add bar blocks the list if it's too long with no way to scroll down. Also would like an option to have completed tasks to disappear not just sit there crossed out taking up space. And make it easier to share lists with others. Should be able to accept invites in app not over email.
It`d be nice but soon we`ll have to Pay to Tweet
"I use this for organizing my homework and it's very helpful!! 10/10 recommend. It's simple to use, it's pretty, and it has tons of features.

I'm a novice free user and I use it primarily to set reminders. I love the way it pops up at the bottom of the screen and the display of the reminders. The design and user friendliness is super cool! It's been a wonderful experience so far and I highly recommend it!
cant make into my calendar
"This does not work the same as wunderlist. When I sort, I cannot manually move items to in effect do a sort alphabetically within priority. Also when I prioritize items, they don't automatically move to the top of the list. With wunderlist going away, I am going to have to search for a new app. So disappointed."

Needs option to sort by due date AND time. Should be able to set some tasks/items to move into next day automatically. Should have custom sort or dedicated grocery store shopping list option so you can sort items by how they're arranged in the store. Please add these options & this would be the best to do app ever!
fun day with boo. short but fun
It wouldn't let me try the app. It just told me to subscribe.

"Tried to plan my weekly schedule with the ""routines"" function, but it kept randomly changing the times of the events as I made other edits.

Also annoying that you can't preview the notification sounds, and have to add silly tags to each event such as ""housework""."

Very good app to focus
Rather new to the app to rate it higher than a 3 at this time. But I like the results it is helping me to achieve. I expect improved time management as I get the app's feature set up to serve me best. I sense I may rate it higher as I experience it benefits more. I do like using it better then Wunderlist.

"The one major short-coming of this app. (and most other ""habit trackers"") is that it does not have any option to calculate a total number (amount of hours, etc.) for a week or month--only a number of days or per day...That is a gaping deficit in these app's (with the exception of one or two with less desirable formats), as it is a far better way to track things like sleep which may fluctuate from.day to day. The other dismaying factor is that Habitbull doesn't seem to have any customer service, as I e-mailed numerous times about issues trying to upgrade (because it is a really helpful/useful application), and never got any response in about a year's time. :-\ Aside from the tabulation inadequacy discussed above--which I really hope they'll address/include that capability, it is a really helpful and useful app., and can be especially helpful for people with issues such as depression or ""OCD"" who may have difficulty keeping a handle on self-care and/or productivity (though, it could, also have the opposite effect, if people with ""OCD"" get too immersed in tracking things in their day-to-day :-S). In general, it is a good tool to have, though, and can help you make a lot of progress on things like household projects, etc., but I really do wish that they'd adjust it so that you can calculate a total for a duration of time longer than a day, and that they would also be conscientious about customer service/support and responding to/fielding correspondence and issues people encounter. ~*Kristin Star*"

Very upset and disappointed."

"Once the app reinstalled itself and I lost everything. I still have no idea why it did this. Also, it often doesn't open when I first tap the icon. If I tap it multiple times it eventually opens within a particular task. I found it frustrating and I've now uninstalled it. It would be a great app if some of these bugs could be resolved."
"Nice app... Good layout and design.. One request- Add tracking as well to the tasks.. then it will be complete solution Along with setting up tasks I need to track as well which tasks I have done today, weekwise and monthwise"

"The app looked very promising, but there were too many ""Upgrade to premium"" notifications when initially clicking through the app. From what I saw, I probably would have paid for a year if I was able to try out the fill app first. Instead, I got what felt like being kicked in the face by upgrade notifications. For these reasons, 3 stars and lost buisness."
It would be great if didn't cost 28.00

well i`m gonna go now.  goodbye all.
i cant set my times for events bc theres no am/pm option. it keeps changing my time not allowing me to put the right thing..annoying
"I would have loved it if not for the fact that there is a problem with the widget on my Huawei p20, unfortunately it gets stuck often and cannot click anything, I tried removing the widget and re-doing it, now it doesn't even show my lists, and I have to go into the app to check or add things, which of course means once I'm done with the current ones I'll delete it. A task app with no immediate access on main screen is not too helpful..."

"I hate working nights, cos I`m not really able to enjoy this gorgeous weather, as I will be asleep"
Implement collaborative lists please! so crucial.
Works well but free version only gives you three total lists
did you have an amazing time?
"Yes, I`m originally from Argentina. And very `mystic` about that  ...ï¿½ bientï¿½t de te lire Quincy!"
"Just lowered my rating. Used to work great but now does not properly sync everything in my task list with my Google Calendar on my computer. It will sync new events & new tasks. But if I edit a task (ex. change the date of the task), it does not sync properly w/ my Google Calendar. It used to be that all edits synced & appeared the same in both the app & my Google Calendar, but not now. I have been emailing with the support for this app, but have not yet found a solution."
Won't do recurring tasks. Does not connect to Gtasks as shown in the cover photo. Hasn't been updated in a long time
where`s the love?
Great app works very well it helps alot especially at this time with this pandemic helps to keep everything that you need to keep track of what and where you should be and to keep track of your symptoms and must know information. Check this app out.
"OK, when will this post RNY girl learn; rich sugary food is a BAD idea! No more golden graham bars out of the vending machine. Bleck!"

My plans for the weekend include working on a paper and driving my guy 2 the airport. Won`t see him for 3 wks.
Gonna run to the gym to get my workout in before my really f`kin big pile of mulch arrives at around 8 or 9am! I`m excited about my mulch
"Its a really good app that has helped to motivate me to revise, i just wish that you could plant real trees without having to purchase forest premium, i also like the design of the app and how easy it is to use"
updated:. was confused that the event list in the actual app wasn't showing events scheduled for the next few days. The widget will only show events in the next 12h. The event list in the app also only shows events in the next 12h. I think this list should list events for that entire day. this means i still depend on other apps for an agenda view.
Great app. I just wish there was a way to keep track of time on a task/habbit (built-in timer instead of having to open an external timer)
I have fantastic friends
"4 shifts down, 2 to go... then its my birthday!! but, should i be getting excited??? im turning 29 which means im almost 30"

Really good alternative for Wunderlist that I wa using before. This one have more features and syncs very well for collaborative use.
Imporant functions can be used only if you subscribe. It would be best if they rather sell this app than make people pay for subscption. It's worth their money anyway.
Just started raining in earnest... guess golf is off for today...
I`m slightly disturbed by Hollyoaks tonight.  I really don`t think it`s something that should have been shown at 6.30pm...

"This app is good, but it will be extra good if the developer put an option to continous timing for focus. I believe there should not be any kind of limit like 10 min. Remove it or give an option to set custom time in hour and minute."

It's alright.

"I dont like that it only works with calendar. i dont want a calendar even called ""sleep"" just to keep it on the graph"
I had made an account for this app a long time ago but didn't use it for long and I forgot why until I re-downloaded it today. This is one of those apps that's incredibly frustrating because a lot of the main advertised features are behind a pay wall and/or you have to make an ADDITIONAL ACCOUNT FOR. Paying more than $1/mo for a list app is ridiculous. If anything it should be a one-time purchase.
Ahhhhhh I got stitches  I seriously cant wait to go to the beach! SUMMER HURRY UP!!!!!!

"Got hold of the Premium version with high expectations but was disappointed on getting to know that the habits created on a device is not appearing on another device with the same account. Going back to ""Loop""."
"So far it's pretty good. I've been using it about a week. Sometimes it doesn't refresh, but the other users on the app seem positive and friendly. There is a lot that I am learning through users that isn't actually explained in the app. Like if you don't do all your daily tasks, the whole party takes damage. So yeah, no pressure! It would be nice for a better help options or a more detailed in-app-fist-time training/learning session. Every 'first' should option for more info!"
"The mothers day classic went really well, despite the cold 5.30am start"
Excellent app for time management and routines. I love how customizable tags are and how versatile the difference between routines and events are. I just wish there was a deeper Google Calendar immersion so that I could edit icons and add tags to imported events.
Very helpful.. Please add more habits for the free version

"Recurring tasks an essential feature is available only in premium. Premium is not available for one time purchase. monthly payment is way too much for an Indian. it got to be affordable with one time payment for everyone to use. may be some one time payment option for different features like recurrent tasks, location reminder and paid themes would have been made it accessible for many."
Looking forward to a better UI/UX. Will keep using it.

"My dad was in NY for a day, we ate at MESA grill last night and met Bobby Flay. So much fun, except I completely lost my voice today."
It has a nice pop up widget for your to do list. The problem with this app is when I want it to alert me always at 9 about it or remind me of my tasks it doesn't. Its just there. I'm still using it but i feel google assistant does a better job of reminding me. So I might delete it later. Not so satisfying.
"I don't understand why do I have to turn on the screen when I grow up the tree. When my screen turns off because of inactivity for 10 minutes, tree dies again. I installed this app to focus on my work (not my phone) but this app keeps requiring me to turn on the phone. It's paradoxical.."

"I absolutely love this app. First of all, it actually works and give me all the motivation I need to get stuff done. Secondly the community is awesome and there is just so much stuff to do! Recommended to everyone looking to develop habits."
"New user and I'm impressed! A lot of neat features I've been looking for in apps like this. it's obvious dev is active and listening and thats a great sign. If I have an immediate suggestion, it'd be for us to be able to add tab categories of traits besides the default characteristics/skills; for example to add things like ""personality"", ""lifestyle"" or however we want to organize our skillset categories, so those 2 sections aren't cluttered. A search option for icons too maybe? Keep it up!"
I hear ya. You`ll have to go back to work to rest.
"I like: * the way it separates lists (""sub lists"") horizontally, and I can switch between them conveniently with swipes, though I tend to accidentally delete tasks when trying to switch lists * I value the convenience of swipe to delete the most * being able to quick add tasks from the main screen, removes one extra tap step * being able to highlight important tasks, but wish it would automatically pin them to the top. Feature I wish most for: Image attachments. Idea: Location-based reminders?"
Good morning Dan! It`s my Bday and I plan on getting some exercise too today!!  Love ya!! See you in NYC!!!
"Do not download this app. There are Ads everything you use i (as of Feb 26, 2020), despite what the developer says about the ""18 hour"". Just read other reviews and you'll see that the intrusive Ads have killed this free app. Look for another similar app"

"I transitioned from Wonderlist. There are a couple of things I don't like. When the list is sorted any way then you can not drag the items in the list. This makes it very hard to organize long lists. Also, I would like to have the option of adding to the top of the list as well as the bottom. Otherwise the app is good for what I need it to do."
"Parece una gran app, pero no se me actualiza el idioma a español, a pesar de que ya lo configure para que asi sea. Una lastima"
thanks for the reminder. Hope all have a great time
"I used to like, even love this app. It was great. Now though, every time I add an event on my calendar an ad comes up and stays there until it is finished. It's awful! So far the ads have not been inappropriate, just annoying. I don't think that going to the pro version would fix this. I don't even know how to find the pro version to purchase as it doesn't show up in the play store. Super frustrating. I don't want to find another app. I just want this one to work without the silly ads."

"Microsoft forces you to use your Microsoft account to use it, then never keeps you logged in long enough to get notifications. Sharing via text feels like I'm back on my Droid phone, and trying to get updates to shared lists suffers from the forced log outs as well. Also can't customize ""smart lists"" that are stuck at the top. My Day and Tasks? That's the same thing for me, either let me put it at the bottom or let me remove them. Microsoft took Wunderlist and ruined it."
"Easily the best task manager app out there, while the rpg aspect is a HUGE plus. The user is able to fully customize pretty much every little bit of the app to make it better suit their habits, or soon-to-be habits!"

Yep. Wasn`t that much to play with though. Just install and voilï¿½! It works  But you need a fast connection...
Happy Mothers Day!
It was a great application but the lastest versions don't notify anymore about events and reminders.. I'll uninstall the application because it's useless. It's ridiculous they know the problem and don't do anything to fix it
Ohh Emmm Geee. Souvlaki from Dimitris...I wanna go homeeee  LOL

"There are more effective, and honest, ways to turn a buck in the Playstore. Crippling your app with a paywall only drives home just how unnecessary the app is."
I love how personalisable this app is and the widget is fantastic. The weather app doesn't always work and my tablet and phone won't sync tasks even when I ask it to manually. 👎
"Word to all those i call mom, and there are a lot of yall.. HAPPY MOTHERS DAY  i love you all!"
i like OGBERRY
is getting ready for bed. Happy Mother`s Day to all the mothers out there!
aww that`s cute
Goodmorning world!
"Good but could be better. It works well and is very similar to Wunderlist, however it's very annoying that the reminders disappear from the notification bar if you haven't completed your task in a day. So you have to reschedule every day. Would be great if this could be fixed."
Is in starbucks

"It's a very good planner app. I had scoured the play store for dozens of planner apps, but none of their free versions were worth my time. This free version is entirely great on it's own and without any ads. However, if you're a student as I am, the duration feature for tasks on the premium app is definitely worth the $2.99 a month"

Congratulations Mr. Jay-el and Mrs. Maricar Chu! Wish you all the best in the world!
Muito interessante 👏
"This app is really good but I have a major issue with it. It helps you focus, not to get distracted but sometimes I need to a calculator or google or a dictionary I can't because my tree will die!! So I need to exit the app(the tree is still growing) and then I can access google or what not please let the app access certain apps if possible."

Enjoy Todoist Premium but an update to the widget has made the fonts smaller. As this is more difficult to see I don't think it's an improvement.
"I can`t wait till it`s Sunday, a new episode of Supernatural but then there are only 6 episodes left now"

"App works pretty well, but if they want me to list out all events and plans in my life, their Privacy Policy needs to get stronger and be better defined. ""We collect your data; here's a vague description of what. We keep it as long as we've decided we need to; and we won't tell you how long that is. We also completely change this policy in a way that we're break the Policy you may have originally agreed to, but it's your responsibility as the user to make sure we don't break our end of the deal. Don't like this? Delete the app"" .. basically the Privacy Policy. Not exactly trust encouraging. Fix this in a privacy friendly way and I'll change my review"
It just works. Nice tight layout. Combines Google & Exchange/Activesync well. Wish I could jump ahead faster than 1 mo at a time.

"It was great before, but lately it sends notifications whenever it likes. It doesn't notify according to schedule anymore. And now, it doesn't notify at all."
"I like this app, but despite all attempts following your steps, the notification is still not working. It used to work just fine, but for some reason, I'm guessing after an update, it will not notify me that the time is up until I press my phone's powers button, meaning I am having to come back to my phone every so often to check if my time is up, which contradicts this apps purpose. I'm sometimes going 20 minutes over time - so much for pomadoro! Please fix this issue!"
wanted to go to the club...dancing;)..but now iï¿½m tired anyways i have to go to work tomorrow!
_Ho Naw; it was before the 15 mins bug (where tanks would stop spawning after 15 mins)  I`m glad I get to keep it

"Reminders are kind of a core feature in a to-do list app. Why should I have to pay for it? The app is fine, but I can't use the reminders."
"I used this app many years ago but I can't remember why I stopped using it. Whatever the reason was, they must have improved a lot because I'm loving the app now. Never been so productive."
"@_iDANCE19 well yes lol ..  i had a chat with them earlier , there just not willing to learn anything else"
If it had reminders in free version it would have been the best to do list.
The pool is just not fun without Tim in it...

"This is terribly buggy and you're better off avoiding it; use the website instead, if you're on your mobile device. Latest update doesn't update habit counters on-screen after you press any buttons; all of the command is processed though. App still doesn't display items that are found. Just another buggy update."
yea he said brooke`s gonna come over to record today!  !
So are you going to watch Star trek or Wolverine..? I bet you are going to watch both  Right?
