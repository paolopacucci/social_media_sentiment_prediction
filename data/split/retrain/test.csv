"I am going to drop this app after years of use because of recent full page video ads which are out of control. Edited to add: of course the free version has ads. Always has, and I don't mind, because *something* has to pay for app development. But these new full page, video that can't be shut down, in your face for many seconds ads are new and intolerable.

I don`t know how to use this,1
Reminder works but I scroll down from top I see the correct items !bc not Google! . If I open I see some old reminders... Sometimes they update. Mostly NOT.... Pls solve the problem once and for all.

"This app has a nice interface and a great idea, but it seems to suffer the same issue I've found of all habit trackers. I can't easily keep track of multiple daily iterations of a habit. If I want to create a habit of say drinking 5 bottles of water a day, I want to be able to check off and keep track of each bottle drunk, then get rewarded when I finish all five. Most of the habits I want to develop fall in this category. Could this be implemented in the future?",1

"Its almost there, but a bit buggy. I used Chrome OS and Chromebook. The app does not handle recurring reminders properly. When I mark the reminder as done it should automatically reschedule for the next occurance. When I mark as 'done' the task goes away forever. I contacted support and shared a video of the behavior. They acknowledge a bug, but that's been weeks ago. I have no faith yet the recurring reminders are reliable. Proceed here with caution if you rely on strong reminders such as I do, as you could be left hanging and missing an important task.",0

I'm giving this app 3 out 5 because there is a really annoying behaviour when you're adding a quick note and if you by mistake tap outside the text box (which one would do on the go) your note is erased and you need to start again. I'm considering uninstalling it because this happens almost every time I add a note which means that it takes me twice the time. Please at least keep the text and don't erase it in case of an accidental tap outside the box. Thanks,1

Perhaps a mind map or something would make it easier.",1
"It doesnt seem to be possible to delete a single event in a series. So if I want to block off an hour every day for the same thing, but then I have to schedule a one-off thing during that time, I can't just delete one occurence and leave the rest of the future occurences alone.

"I love it except, and this is a big issue for me, it's totally server based. Want to update anything, but have a bad internet connection? Too bad, it's either going to take forever or fail. I would use and maybe even pay for this app to just have a way to have everything first be saved on my device. So, back to hunting for a to-do app. Edit 3/23: I have to drop my review on this to 1 star. You can manually edit values within the app for stats making any it unreasonable that I need internet.",0
"I don`t think any of what i just said it true, i just had a rant about mcfly, i cant belive i did that  i feel ashamed",0

"It's a GREAT app. 4 Stars because I think one addition would be a way to have 2 identical widgets running without being connected. Like 1 widget set for my daily goals tasks (shower, laundry, gym), and the second widget for tasks I update and add throughout the day (pick up milk, get haircut)! That way i don't get overwhelmed by a single long list but instead have 2 smaller lists. I'm a ""one screen all widgets"" guy. Another addition would possibly be a widget calendar list, instead of having the 30 day calendar + each days events. Seems useless to have such a huge window of calendar days when I really just need to have a list of events of each day. Samsung calendar has this widget and it's perfect.",2
"I use an external track ball with my laptop. Again, seems excessive, but is totally more efficient.",2
Hate subscription uninstalled,0
I have to work tomorrow too sheli,1
"ugh something is wrong, suddenly I feel extremely flushed and shaky and I broke out in a sweat. Idk what`s wrong.",0
This used to be a very good calendar app with plenty of good features in the free version already. Unfortunately they introduced intrusive full-screen ads recently to force you into buying the premium version. I'll rather switch to another calendar app than be blackmailed like that.,0
"Cool, I used to live 5 houses to the left of that place  Always something going on :p",2

"You can't set a location by name, only address. Yes I tried setting my location manually, like that would be at all useful. Do you even understand what I'm saying? I CANT TYPE IN LA FITNESS AND GET AN ADDRESS. It will just send me to whichever is closest. Setting my location wouldn't help, it would just send me to the closest one to my manual instead of one that may be further... Worthless.",0

since the May 1st update it made me create my character 15+ times before I uninstalled and reinstalled before having to do it again and spending close to 45 minutes deleting pre generated habits dailies and to dos to get to my original ones. Terrible. I love the app otherwise. Update: since the new update it is fixed.,2

"I have used this app for my business for a looong time and love it. However can someone explain to me why I'm getting spam notifications from BC2 announcing my winning stuff like shoes and iPhones? At least once a week this happens and as I said I use it for my business and don't really have time to forward these things to 10 of my friends via Whatsap, which I do not use. If it's you guys, stop it. If it's some other hijinks then let me know how to fix it, please.",0
"This app is perfect for tracking my habits. It allows an effective level of depth without being overwhelming. I have been using this for several months and I love it. The only thing I would like to see would be ""Milestones"" to increase/decrease a habit without retroactively turning past week successes into failures. For example, increasing a workout habit from 2x/wk to 3x/wk.",2

Had the best night I`ve had in a while.,2
HabitBull is what I was looking for in a habit tracking app. It has a lot of customization for what constitutes a goal streak and a simple overview and data entry screen. I was happy that premium is just a one-time fee. And it's cool to see the posts from other people working on their goals too.,2
