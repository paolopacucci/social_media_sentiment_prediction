Supper helpful for me as a busy college student. I often forget all the things I have to do each day and this helps me visualize what's next.

"Just had a big visual update but if anything the app is getting worse and worse. Now most of the time when I tap a plus sign to increase count of something, nothing happens.

More options needed such as daily time line view, font size & highlight current day. Editing isn't easy & I think the whole app including widget could have a neater, tidier look.

"Widget is buggy - a task marked as completed in the app is displayed as overdue, and trying to tick it off in the widget takes me into edit mode. The proper app, when reopened, shows a blank inbox and revisiting the screen is required to populate it again. Poor punctuation (eg. ""28 Sep , 2017” - why the space before the comma) is not that big a deal, but also adds to the app not feeling very ""pro"".",0

"Deleted review accidentally. 1. I create habit type tasks: the ones that repeat regularly. I don't even dream to have a habit/statistical section, but THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO SKIP OR FAIL THE REPEATABLE TASK. Now I only can delete it, but is is not representative way. 2. There has to be a way to exclude a list from the ""all tasks"" list. For example I have list with books to read and films to watch. A lot of tasks, that look bad in the ""all tasks"" list, I loose real important ""no date"" tasks because of it. You redirect me to your uservoice, but according to it excluding list from ""all tasks"" list has been ""in roadmap"" for 2 years, don't think you really care and your uservoice makes any difference. I know that adding habit tracker might be a heavy feature, but failing the task, or skipping it? Hell no. As well as excluding lists feature, it's also an easy one. But two years? Meh. Just don't pretend you care, be straightforward, like, 'we won't do it in the nearest future, not in our plans'.",0

So far this app has been terrific. With all its catagories that you can organize your tasks into it keeps it from getting cluttered and confusing. So far all the alarms have been working and functioning as they are supposed to and it has been easy to use with a quick tutorial when you first open it up.,2
"Pretty great app, motivates me to do stuff I normally wouldn't want to because of the prospect of leveling up. One small gripe I have is that if something with a reminder is marked complete before the reminder goes off, it still reminds you even though you've already done it. Also, sounds when you mark something, etc come out the Ringtone channel, not the Media channel.",2
"No background sync. I love the UI and widget, but it won't update notes I create/change from the PC unless I physically open the app, which renders it useless for my needs.",0

Please work on updates because very soon i might not use it if i still have to re-enter all my days task and activities!!!

Extremely helpful for users of all age groups; and with the Backup & Sync features you just can't go wrong with this app!",2

"So far, so good. I love the reminders because they check in you throughout the day, rather than just once a day. This has definitely helped me develop a routine. I may keep it on longer than the prescribed 66 days. The app claims it takes that long to develop a lasting habit but the daily reminders help me best. This app is good for that.",2

"This is by far the best to do list app I've come by. It has rich features and a great interface, even in the free version. It knows the difference between a task, and a habit. My main issue here with the app, is premium pricing. Why exactly do I have to pay a monthly fee for features that can be used offline? Normally, a monthly subscription is to support features that need to be consistently paid for. From what I can see, there's only one. If a one time payment option is added, I'll buy it.",1

This was fantastic for my daily workplan. So easy to do. I was up and running after 10 minutes. Very easy to edit like move tasks to next day or another date if not complete. You can add real time to tasks helpful for setting up order of priority on list. You can select those tasks that repeat and set them up. It has an alarm reminder My husband downloaded it and can do many org things too. Get it.,2
This app has most features for a free habit tracker and even the onetime payment is the cheapest in this category. The habit tracker of choice.,2

"This is a great app, and I love it, bit I have two small issues with it. First, I don't like how insistent it is with notifying you to complete tasks. Second, I wish the interface had a better tutorial so that it would be easier to have the due dates and such easy to prepare when you enter the task in. Since fixing one would fix both, this is still a great app",2
"It's ok. There's no actual options to make a list. I have to number each 
item (task, action, etc) myself & in paragraph form. There's no proper list 
formatting in there. Besides that, it's alright. Not what I had hoped :(",1
"It doesnt work for what I was looking for - something to track my habits, not judge them. I dont want to focus on if I ""succeeded"" that day, I just want to have an idea of where I am in numbers.",1

"Hey, guys! This is good idea! However, I have a feedback for you: Several times I accidentally was clicking task more than once, so I was increasing my level. I didn't found related settings. I think you should make task clickable (checkable, do you get me?) )only once per day, and highlight the finished tasks. This features will prevent accidental checking, therefore increasing level incorrectly. Could you explain me how to use such features, if you already have them??",1
i didnt get the joke,0
Does exactly one thing - tracks habits - but does it well and without pointless bloaty extras (or ads). Clean interface. Sadly app seems to have been abandoned by developers and premium features like sync no longer work. No way to transfer data.,1

"Honestly great. Simple. Effective. 1 time purchase. The UI has a sort of dated look but it's very quick and easy to use. Most of my daily habits vary alot based on which day it is, my schedule varies so much I cant put them on a specifik time, and I almost always do them in the same order. Therefore there should be an option to change the order of the habits manually, yourself, without any variables. :)",2
